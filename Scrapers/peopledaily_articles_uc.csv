People Daily,Is Mt Kenya becoming epicentre of protests?,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/is-mt-kenya-becoming-epicentre-of-protests,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 12:20 AM","The recent wave of unrest in Mount Kenya has sparked national debate, raising questions about the region’s shifting political dynamics, economic frustrations, and deep-seated historical grievances. Governance and political expert Prof Fred Ogola argues that the growing dissent in the region stems from a perception that Mt Kenya has been side-lined from the corridors of power. He dismisses the idea that last year’s impeachment of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua is the primary trigger, pointing instead to deeper economic and historical undercurrents. “Mt Kenya suffers when the economy suffers,” Ogola says, arguing that people from the populous region are the largest investors in the economy if looked at ethnically. “If the region shares over 70 per cent of national revenue with the Great Rift Valley communities, that would mean nearly 75 per cent of government tenders go to Mt Kenya. But now, it looks like the Rift communities want to take the 75 per cent and place Mt Kenya among the ‘others.’ That is not acceptable to them.” Ogola states that Mt Kenya is economically robust, numerically strong and socially influential, factors that make it difficult for the region to accept a perceived demotion in national significance. “The Luo Nyanza region has historically been politically strong but lacks economic muscle. Mount Kenya, on the other hand, has always had economic clout and rotating political ‘kings’ from Jomo Kenyatta to Kenneth Matiba, Mwai Kibaki, Uhuru Kenyatta, and now Gachagua, who’s struggling to fit that role,” he notes. He also raises questions about the nature of some of the protests in Central Kenya, suggesting that not all are organically driven. “I highly doubt that a Mount Kenya resident would burn down Magunas supermarket. Looting, maybe, but burning their own businesses? That doesn’t make sense. Some of these acts could be State-sponsored to paint the region in a certain light,” he asserts. Ogola believes there’s growing resentment within the community over being lumped among the “others,” a term often used in national discourse to describe minority or marginalised groups. “Mt Kenya people do not see themselves as ‘others.’ Economically, culturally, and historically, they view themselves as the backbone of the country,” he adds. Political analyst Ayub Mwangi however argues that the region has always been a protest zone, even if the demonstrations have not always taken to the streets. “If you look at it historically, the region has had its fair share of unrest — even during Kenyatta’s time. The only president who didn’t experience protest from Mount Kenya was Kibaki. The people might not have protested in numbers before, but this new wave is simply a continuation of a longstanding culture,” Mwangi argues. Mwangi adds that the “one-term presidency” narrative has agitated many in the region, fuelling a sense of betrayal and exclusion. He also believes there is a possibility that elements within the government are manipulating the situation. “The State could be fuelling these protests by enabling criminal elements to hijack them,” he says. “You find roads to the city blocked, yet armed groups somehow get in. The government could be using this to criminalise genuine dissent.” At the core of the unrest, both analysts agree, are economic grievances. Mount Kenya’s business community feels under pressure, facing what they describe as systemic harassment and dwindling support from the State. “During Moi’s era, sectors like tea, milk, and coffee virtually collapsed, and it’s only under Kibaki that we saw an effort to revive them,” Mwangi notes. “Even then, small-scale businesspeople felt that their economic interests were never fully protected,” he adds, arguing that the economic marginalisation of the region dates back decades. “During Moi’s rule, Mt Kenya figures like Charles Rubia, Kenneth Matiba, and Koigi wa Wamwere were detained for political dissent. This shows that the region has historically resisted oppressive governance.” From colonial resistance to one-party state repression, Mount Kenya has consistently pushed back against regimes it deems unjust a legacy that seems to be resurfacing in today’s protests. According to analysts, while the faces and flags may have changed, the region’s underlying grievances remain rooted in long-standing issues of economic inclusion, political representation, and perceived betrayal by successive governments But political analyst Peter Kagwanja says the Mt Kenya region has been made a “political target because it is very vulnerable.” Just like in the Moi regime when the key economic activities were crippled, he adds, the government is now applying the same tactic to bring down the region. Kagwanja also believes the Ruto regime is out to decapitate the leaders who appear to have influence in the region to make them dysfunctional because he is feeling threatened. He says the agitation by the youth is not a regional problem but rather a national issue, but there is an attempt to spin it and create an impression that the protests are emanating from Mt Kenya to play tribal politics. “There is an attempt to separate the Mt Kenya community from the other communities and turn the people against each other,” says Kagwanja, noting that the same strategy was used to subdue the Mau Mau as they were made to fight each other and their strength weakened. “This time, the unity of the region is the target,” he adds. On the issue of hired goons, he says both the leaders and the business community could have sponsored the youths leading to a chaotic scenario. He describes the protests that have been happening in the country as a prolonged low-intensity civil war, adding that it’s high time the President calls for a dialogue and sorts out the matter with Gen Z. Macharia Njeru, also an analyst, cautions the residents against being incited into violence saying this is a ploy to dismantle the region ahead of 2027. “Mt Kenya should not agree to be incited and be separated from other communities because we cannot survive on our own,” he says. He however wonders why the leaders from the region are still silent over the issue yet they can see how the people are being persecuted."
People Daily,Kiambu 12-year-old student shot dead as she watches TV,https://peopledaily.digital/news/kiambu-12-year-old-student-shot-dead-as-she-watches-tv,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 12:40 AM","Tears and despair gripped families in Kiambu after six people, including a 12-year-old girl, were killed by police during “Saba Saba Day” protests. The victims’ families are demanding justice, compensation and an independent investigation into the use of live bullets by police. Lucy Ngugi whose 12-year-old daughter Bridgit Njoki was shot dead while watching TV at their home in Ndumberi village was inconsolable. “It was around 6:20 pm, and we were at home as a family when tragedy struck as a stray bullet penetrated our house and hit my daughter on the head,” Ngugi recounted, adding that their home is some metres away from the main road where protests were taking place. Njoki died while being resuscitated at St. Brigid’s Hospital. Another victim, Dennis Mutuma Mwangi, 23, was shot dead outside his home in Kiambu town. His mother, Friday Kawira, tearfully stated, “My son was shot from the back, meaning he was running away. The bullet exited through the neck, killing him instantly right outside our home.” She insists her son was not protesting but had just stepped outside to see what was happening after washing his clothes. Laban Kamau was also shot in the head in Ndumberi village. His mother, Margaret Wangui, expressed her shock: “Ndumberi is a village and not a town centre, we were shocked to see such protests which have left me without a son and it is so hurtful since my son is not a criminal to be gunned down like that.” To add insult to injury, the families are being charged mortuary and post-mortem fees at the Kiambu Level Five Hospital despite their loved ones’ deaths being attributed to police shootings. They are calling on the government to cover hospital bills and burial preparations, emphasising that the killings were uncalled for since live bullets were used by police to disperse protesters. The violence also left 18-year-old Kevin Muiruri, a student, with gunshot injuries to his left leg in Kabete. Muiruri was reportedly running away from the skirmishes when he was shot. He said the officers walked away after shooting him and was later rescued by well-wishers who took him to hospital. Former Kiambu MP Jude Njomo, who visited the grieving families, echoed calls for independent investigations. “How can the police who have killed the young people investigate themselves? We need international bodies to investigate and give the victims who were shot by police justice,” he stated. He also criticised police reports for allegedly understating the number of casualties, citing the official report of only one death in Kiambu contradicting the six lives confirmed by families. Parents also raised concerns about the alleged use of “goons” by the authorities in the Mt Kenya region. They accused the police of targeting innocent young people who are not involved in looting or throwing stones and sparing the agitators. Yesterday, reports indicated that at least 11 people were killed and at least 29 injured during the Saba Saba Day anniversary protests."
People Daily,Karua: Citizens can appoint IEBC if deadlock persists,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/karua-citizens-can-appoint-iebc-if-deadlock-persists,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 12:22 AM","People’s Liberation Party (PLP) leader Martha Karua has declared that Kenyans have the constitutional power to directly appoint commissioners to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), especially in moments when state institutions appear to be failing the people. Speaking during an interview on a local TV station on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, Karua said democracy does not only belong to those in office, but to the people themselves, who have the power to act when systems are broken or manipulated. “The people can be able to even appoint an IEBC through direct exercise of power. It has not been done before but it is possible,” Karua said. Adding; “Power belongs to the people. Democracy is a government of the people, for the people, and by the people. They have the final say.” Karua drew comparisons with international events, citing the case of Bangladesh, where citizens, in an unprecedented show of unity, overthrew a sitting leader and chose their own preferred leadership despite institutional limitations. She said that should be a reminder to Kenyans that they too can take matters into their own hands if the democratic process is hijacked. “The people of Bangladesh had not chased a leader from office before, but they did. They chose Yunus. I don’t know how they communicated, whether it was via the internet, but they did that directly,” the seasoned politician stated. She said the same spirit of people-led change had already started taking shape in Kenya, especially through recent waves of youth-led protests that have caught the attention of both government and international observers. “Even in Kenya, the people have the power to appoint the IEBC. Before June 2024, if someone had suggested that there would be an awakening, youths taking to the streets in a very patriotic way, we would have seen it as impossible,” she said. Adding; “The Gen Z have since surpassed that. They are organising it even better. If someone had said that a regime would sack a cabinet because the people have demanded, we would have said it’s impossible, but all that happened thanks to the young people saying enough is enough. It is possible.” During the interview, Karua also launched a sharp attack on President William Ruto, accusing him of deliberately creating a leadership vacuum at the IEBC to interfere with preparations for the 2027 General Elections. She asserted that the president engineered the illegal exit of all commissioners to delay the electoral process and manipulate it in his favour. “If Ruto wants us to meet him at the ballot, let him change his ways. He and his illegitimate rogue regime. If not, Kenyans have the power to terminate your contract earlier,” she warned. Adding; “Ruto deliberately and illegally pushed out IEBC commissioners whose tenure would still have been valid to delay the process. It is not right that all commissioners go at the same time and we are left without IEBC. That is why there was a broken down hiring.” Karua’s remarks come at a time when the country is facing a serious electoral crisis. The IEBC has been without a chairperson or commissioners since the exit of the Cherera Four in 2022, and the retirement of former Chair Wafula Chebukati and commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye. On June 10, 2025, President Ruto attempted to fill the vacant positions by appointing seven new commissioners, including Chairperson Erastus Ethekon. However, their swearing-in was blocked by a High Court order following a wave of legal petitions. The petitioners argued that the appointment process lacked inclusivity, transparency, gender balance, and failed to represent minorities and persons with disabilities, as required by the Constitution. The High Court is expected to deliver a ruling on July 10, which will determine whether the appointments stand or will be nullified."
People Daily,Father's joy & struggle raising daughter alone,https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/fathers-joy-struggle-raising-daughter-alone,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 04:00 AM","In 2008, Jay Walemba’s life took an unexpected turn. He became a father at the age of 21 and had not planned for it. When his girlfriend became pregnant, he was left with no choice but to marry young and start a family. Now 37, Walemba reflects on that turning point moment. As a young husband and father, Walemba embraced his role as the head of the family. At the time of his marriage, he had not furthered his education beyond secondary level and thus made the decision to return to school for a better life. He also paid for his wife’s university education to help her upgrade from a diploma to a degree. But looking back, he realised this was a costly gamble. “I painfully learnt that while she was doing her degree, she was dating someone else. Immediately after she cleared and graduated, she came back and carried everything, including my daughter, in 2016. I was then working in Naivasha. After she left, I became single and heartbroken. I painfully learnt to accept the new reality.” It was a difficult transition for father and daughter. Walemba recounts an incident in 2020 when his daughter called him one morning when he was at work. The girl wanted to see him because her mother was mistreating her. Walemba pulled strings here and there and organised for his daughter to get to where he was. “By then my daughter was 12. What prompted me to get my daughter, was because the mother was treating her badly and she also didn’t want any connection with me. Anytime the mom would hear that I went to see my daughter in school she would transfer her to a new school where I didn’t know. That affected the child a lot,” Walemba says. Walemba adds that within four years, her daughter had been transferred to six schools. The transfers from one school to another were so many that they affected the girl mentally, emotionally and academically. The father had to act to save the situation. Through effort and determination, he was able to get full custody of the child and started living with her. Navigating the path of a single father raising a teenager (the girl is now 17 years old) has not been easy. With the girl deep in her teens, the father has had to navigate issues like discussing her menstrual cycle and reproductive health issues. When the issues her daughter is facing get too hot for the father to handle, he engages the help of his sisters and female friends, who help him to navigate the tricky waters. The biggest challenge he has faced raising his teenage daughter single-handedly is how to fill the gap of a mother’s love and care. “One of the biggest challenges is that she’s not able to get that mother’s love, and then there are communication barriers as I’m not able to create that safe and open environment where she can share personal issues comfortably. Sometimes, I take her out for dinner to bond and connect with her but sometimes she declines the offer,” Walemba says. Walemba highlights another challenge she faces is helping her with personal grooming, self-care and homecare issues, which is mostly a woman’s territory. He further adds that sometimes the daughter faces social stigma when other students ask her why they only see her father coming for visiting days and why she doesn’t have a mother. Such inquiries make her daughter feel isolated. Another challenge is dating other women, as a single father. “There’s a time I tried finding another woman and dating. I even introduced her to this lady and they became friends, but it never worked out. Sometimes she would be moody, especially when she feels that I’m giving the lady more attention than her. During a date, when we are having dinner together and I’m conversing more with the lady, her mood changes, so I felt that I need to give her time to clear school and settle since she is in form three and I don’t want to affect her performance,” Walemba says. Raising a teenage daughter in this digital age is not a walk in the park. “I’ve been forced to be a strict parent when it comes to gadgets. For example, I gave her a smartphone and I was monitoring her activities on my laptop. I noted that she was posting stuff I was uncomfortable with and I took the phone and donated it to a children’s home. She was angry at me.” Finding time for his male friends is a challenge too, he admits. “Sometimes  I want to hang out late with my male friends, but I feel that I need to take care of her so I go home early,” Walemba says. Indeed, raising a child as a single parent has its fair share of challenges. According to therapist Dr. Zipporah Nyangara, single parenting is not an easy journey especially on the child’s side as it may pose psychological challenges. This is because there is the feeling of abandonment and rejection especially where co-parenting is not working. She further notes that the feeling of abandonment can further lead to anxiety and trust issues later in life when the child is grown up and married. “In the event one of the parents is absent, it leads to low self-esteem because this child wants to compare themselves with their peers and classmates, and they may start questioning their self-worth,” Dr. Nyangara says. She adds that when both parents are present in a child’s life it’s easy for them to take responsibility and share parental roles. “When it comes to social development some children develop independence because they know that they have to take care of themselves and have to be resilient. Others will struggle with trust issues and seeking validation from peers. They seek for validation because they are not used to it or they have not seen it growing up,” Dr, Nyangara says. In order to mitigate the potential psychological challenges that may arise in children who are raised by single parents, Nyangara advocates for single parents to have a father or a mother figure to help fill that crucial gap. “As a parent, allow children to express themselves, encourage independence by letting the children learn how to solve problems and be independent. Most importantly, have enough quality time with your child, get to understand their likes and dislikes and also encourage them by telling them they are beautiful or handsome, as this will boost their self-esteem,” Nyangara advises. Meanwhile, tough as it is, Walemba continues to raise his 17-year-old daughter on his own, navigating the challenges of single parenting with commitment and care. He has learnt to seek support from female relatives and friends to help his daughter’s specific needs. His advice to fellow single parents is to allow their kids to be themselves without bounds, encourage independence, spend quality family time together, and offer endless reassurance to help strengthen their self-esteem and emotional stability."
People Daily,Cohesion body calls out leaders over incitement,https://peopledaily.digital/news/cohesion-body-calls-out-leaders-over-incitement,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 03:40 AM","The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) has told political, religious, civic and community-based leaders not to incite young people for political gain even as it made it clear that it is ready to spearhead talks between the government and youths to resolve the current differences between the two. At a news conference on July 8, 2025, NCIC chairperson Samuel Kobia said that Kenya’s meaningful healing will not come through confrontation but through genuine conversations aimed at addressing the major challenges facing the nation. He said that as a guardian of national conscience and cohesion, they have been intentional and deliberate in engaging Gen Z to incorporate their valuable and significant perspectives in the implementation of the Transgenerational Framework. He said: “Let us listen to each other, learn from one another, and walk forward as one people. As a Commission, we remain committed to facilitating these dialogues across the country and ensuring that the voices of all generations are not only heard but acted upon.” He added: “We urge all leaders-political, religious, civic, and community-based-not to incite or exploit the frustrations of young people for political gain. Instead, we call on them to join efforts to mentor, guide, and empower the youth as active contributors to nation-building. It is time to turn protests into platforms for progress and frustrations into fuel for reform.” In his statement, Kobia instead that the commission is the best place to lead the talks as they are the ones who started the transgenerational Conversations that brought together voices from four generations namely the Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Z to be able to address some of the issues currently prevailing the country. The conversations, he said, brought together various participants such as the Mau Mau freedom fighter Gitu wa Kahengeri, former Chief Justice Dr Willy Mutunga, renowned human rights defender Njeri Kabeberi, and a vibrant representation of Millennials and Gen Z. Kobia regretted that the unrest being experienced is a loud and painful signal of the growing discontent among our youth commonly known as Gen Z’s as they feel excluded, unheard, and increasingly disillusioned. According to him, their frustration stems from a combination of factors ranging from high unemployment, economic hardship, lack of trust in institutions, limited opportunities, and a perceived failure of leadership to address their needs and aspirations. He said: “The Transgenerational Conversation, a brainchild of NCIC was developed in response to the Commission’s desire to bridge generational divides in Kenya. Recognizing the increasing disconnect between age groups. NCIC saw the urgent need to create a conducive environment where meaningful dialogue between generations could flourish.” The commission’s sentiments come hardly a day after Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga called for an urgent national dialogue to address Kenya’s socio-political and economic crisis that has seen thousands troop to the streets in protest. At a press conference, Raila proposed the establishment of what he called a national conclave to chart a new path for the country through collective civic engagement and reform. He said: “The most important struggle is for good governance and economic opportunities, who was among the vocal young political leaders opposing then-President Daniel Moi’s regime in the 1090s.”"
People Daily,Blame game over economic ruin in Mt Kenya during protests,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/blame-game-over-economic-ruin-in-mt-kenya-during-protests,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 03:20 AM","As the dust begins to settle over Monday’s bloody Saba Saba day protests, the damage left behind became clear with the Mt Kenya region having borne the brunt of the skirmishes even as its leaders blamed each other for the chaos. The demonstrations, which left more than 10 people dead, mainly hit Mt Kenya counties, compared to the previous demonstrations that were mainly witnessed in perceived ODM strongholds. Tens of supermarkets, shops, cars and other investments were looted and destroyed in scenes never witnessed before in the region that was still trying to come to terms with the impeachment of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua last year. The wave of destruction ignited questions about whether the protests were organised by politicians, amid claims that some leaders and investors targeted their rivals’ businesses. Investments, Trade and Industry Cabinet Secretary Lee Kinyanjui while condemning the destruction of properties, called for sobriety saying that Kenyans should not continue to allow such acts to happen. “My heart bleeds for the many businesses that were vandalised, looted and burned down. Thousands now have no place to report to work or sell their wares. This is both defeatist and retrogressive. We cannot sacrifice our businesses and terminate jobs to protest the cost of living—doing so only worsens the problem,” he said. In separate press conferences and in their various social media platforms, a section of the leaders accused the group led by Gachagua of financing goons to destroy people’s properties while the former Mathira MP’s team claimed the goons were State-sponsored. At a news conference at a Nairobi hotel, MPs allied to Gachagua called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate President William Ruto claiming that the violence was State-sponsored, alleging that they are aware of a well-orchestrated economic sabotage to drive a divisive political narrative and instil fear among the people of Mt Kenya and other regions perceived to be opposition zones. The areas include Kiambu, Naivasha, Nairobi, Murang’a, Nyeri, Embu, Meru, Kirinyaga, Nyandarua, Ongata Rongai, Ngong, Kiserian, Kisii, Machakos, Wote and Kitengela. Led by Murang’a Senator Joe Nyutu and MPs Onesmus Ngogoyo (Kajiado North), Jane Kihara (Naivasha) and James Gakuya (Embakasi North), the leaders claimed that the goons were procured through MPs and sent to different zones where they were not known by the locals. The said goons, they added, were deployed by the government past midnight and given clear instructions to damage specific properties owned by people from the Mt Kenya region. Reads the statement: “We call for strict sanctions on President William Ruto by the international community for this and many crimes he has committed in other countries including the war in Sudan, the MPs statement read, adding that the 17 counties that experienced extreme and planned violence contribute over 66 per cent of the nation’s GDP. “This points to a clear plan of economic sabotage and purge on the people. In non-opposition zones, to some extent, demonstrations were peaceful and there was no looting or destruction of property because the government did not plan and deploy goons.” Ngogoyo who read the statement, claimed that in Nyeri town for instance, goons were organised to loot and beat up journalists under police supervision and protection, in Limuru town, goons were dropped at 7 am and proceeded to light tyres on the road as police watched while on Waiyaki way, Kiambu Road and Thika Road, thugs beat up people and looted as police watched. In addition, he pointed an accusing finger at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) whom he accused of unleashing terror on innocent Kenyans as unmarked Subaru vehicles were seen shooting at people indiscriminately in various parts of Nairobi, Kajiado and Kiambu Counties. The MP claimed that some of the police officers had informed them in confidence that they had clear instructions not to arrest any goon in specific areas at the scene of the crime. “On Sunday, June 6, 2025, at a church function in Meru, Tigania West, Buuri MP Mugambi Rindikiri, in front of CS for Interior Kipchumba Murkomen, said that supermarkets in Meru would be raided on Monday, July 7, 2025. True to his word, Magunas supermarket was raided and torched. How did he know about it before if at all he wasn’t among the planners or the key planner?” Ngogoyo wondered, adding that the Interior CS and the President should be well aware that they shall be held personally liable under International and local laws. “The script by the President is one of dictatorial tendencies, discrimination and economic sabotage of Mt Kenya to suppress them. A violation of the very constitution he swore to uphold.” Mukurweini MP John Kaguchia, on his social media account, claimed that it is the government that sponsored the goons who unleashed terror on Kenyans. “What goes on in your mind when you are elected in Mt Kenya region and you aid the rogue government in planning, strategising and executing of this evil plan to disenfranchise our business people through well-coordinated destruction of property in the name of creating a messaging narrative (propaganda) that its Mt Kenya people who are destructive to their own property,” he posted on Facebook. “How do you guys feel when propagating the same propaganda well knowing the destruction you have caused to your brothers and sisters?! When you shall finally leave politics (soon) where shall you go back to? Power is transient and temporal! I call upon our leaders to self-examine themselves and make life decisions to be loyal to their people for once…” East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) MP Kanini Kega told off those who hired goons to attack Kenyans. Former Chief Justice David Maraga said that the violence witnessed on Monday is not an inter-generational conflict, neither is it an ethnic nor constitutional crisis requiring a referendum, or yet another handshake, but a failure of leadership that has exposed the President’s abdication of responsibilities. To this end, Maraga proposed that leaders and organisations find a solution to the institutional and leadership crisis, various institutions to be held accountable, adding that all those involved in the killing, injuring and maiming of Kenyans be arraigned in court. “We face a deep crisis. We are in the abyss of instability. But we do not have to give in to anarchy. We can prevent more bloodshed. We can prevent the destruction of property. A moment like this calls upon us to write the next chapter of the history of our nation with the ink of moral fortitude,” the CJ Emeritus said. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma while defending Ruto called for an end to the protests saying it is keeping away investors. “William Ruto is your President. Respect him as your leader and join him in nation-building. He has done well stabilising Kenya’s economy which President Uhuru collapsed through debts. Stop all street protests, it is chasing/keeping away investors Kenya needs to create job opportunities for our skilled youths. No one invests in an environment of uncertainty, chaos and anarchy,” he posted on X. Ruto’s senior adviser Moses Kuria applauded the Mt Kenya business community for protecting their properties. “Mount Kenya Business Community. You have done me proud. Do not allow anyone to destroy your business unless they are paying bank loans with you. I am here behind you as a colleague businessman. Remember you are also there for the people you employ and their families,” the former Trade CS said."
People Daily,How learning centres can help end harmful practices like FGM,https://peopledaily.digital/insights/how-learning-centres-can-help-end-harmful-practices-like-fgm,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 03:00 AM","As efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation (FGM) gain momentum across Migori County and other parts of Kenya, schools are emerging as powerful platforms for change. Traditionally seen as centres of learning, schools are now becoming safe spaces where harmful cultural practices like FGM are openly challenged through targeted interventions. Female Genital Mutilation, defined by the World Health Organisation as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to female genital organs for non-medical reasons, remains deeply rooted in some communities. Despite national legislation banning FGM in Kenya, the practice persists, with a 21 per cent prevalence according to KDHS 2022, especially in rural and pastoralist areas. Stakeholders increasingly recognise that schools can play a transformative role in shifting attitudes and ending the cycle of silence that perpetuates FGM. One of the most effective school-based interventions has been integrating FGM-related content into the curriculum. Life Skills Education, taught across primary and secondary schools, includes topics on sexual and reproductive health, children’s rights, gender equality, and the harmful effects of FGM. These lessons empower learners with knowledge about their bodies, rights, and the dangers of undergoing the cut. By equipping both girls and boys with factual information, schools help challenge myths and reduce acceptance of the practice among the younger generation. Many schools have established anti-FGM clubs or child rights clubs, providing students with opportunities to discuss gender-based violence issues, build self-confidence, and learn how to report cases of abuse. Teachers trained in child protection serve as club patrons and offer mentorship, encouraging open dialogue about topics that are often taboo in their communities. Such clubs create awareness and nurture a culture of peer support and advocacy. Schools have also incorporated methodologies like film screenings and positive masculinity sessions to spur discussion among learners. Another vital intervention has been training teachers and school administrators on child safeguarding and FGM prevention. Teachers are often the first adults to notice signs of distress or absenteeism linked to FGM-related threats. With proper training, they can identify at-risk girls, report suspected cases to child protection authorities, and provide psychosocial support. Some schools have partnered with community health promoters and local NGOs to create referral pathways for at-risk learners. Boarding schools, particularly in FGM-prone regions, play a crucial protective role. During school holidays, when FGM is most commonly practised under the guise of cultural initiation ceremonies, many girls risk being taken to their rural homes for cutting. Some schools, in collaboration with local administrations and civil society, have operated as rescue centres or safe shelters for girls who fear being subjected to FGM during breaks. In the fight against FGM, schools are not just places of learning – they are pillars of protection and change. By embedding anti-FGM messages in school culture, Kenya is raising a generation that will finally put an end to this harmful tradition. The writer is a Migori County-based NAYA Youth Advocate"
People Daily,Season of turmoil: Businesses looted as unrest hits Mt Kenya,https://peopledaily.digital/news/season-of-turmoil-businesses-looted-as-unrest-hits-mt-kenya,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 02:40 AM","A dramatic political shift is unfolding as the traditionally conservative Mt Kenya region becomes the new epicentre of street demonstrations, overshadowing the long-standing protest strongholds of Nyanza and Western counties. The protests have devastated local businesses, with major retail chains including Naivas, Maguna Andu, Quickmart, CleanShelf and Stagematt suffering break-ins and massive looting across Central region towns. Goods worth millions of shillings were stolen from their franchises. Regional leaders have condemned the violent protests, warning they risk driving the area into economic ruin. Investments, Trade and Industry Cabinet Secretary Lee Kinyanjui became the latest leader to castigate the perpetrators, calling their actions “defeatist and retrogressive”. “My heart bleeds for the many businesses that were vandalised, looted, and burned down. Thousands now have no place to report to work or sell their wares. This is both defeatist and retrogressive,” Kinyanjui said. The former Nakuru governor warned residents they cannot sacrifice businesses and terminate jobs to protest the cost of living, as this only worsens the problem. “We have added more people to the jobless bench. Anarchy is not the panacea to the challenges our society faces,” the CS said. Former Kirinyaga senator Charles Kibiru called the property destruction “uncalled for”, adding that youth can hold peaceful demonstrations without targeting business premises. “They should not destroy properties because they will affect the same businesses that should be employing them. I also want to imagine it is not instigated to isolate the community for political reasons,” Kibiru said. Kibiru warned that the entire country faces a “time bomb” over the large number of educated but unemployed youth with internet access. “Kenya has so many idle young people who are educated but unemployed. Lack of something to do is causing an increase in activism in these regions,” he said. He rejected impressions that the political class has created among Kenyans that the Central region is marginalised as the new opposition backyard, leading to intense protests against the government. Kibiru noted that regions previously synonymous with protests have stepped back from the streets because their ringleaders now occupy the inner circle of the Kenya Kwanza government. During Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi’s homecoming in Ugunja, Siaya County, last August, President William Ruto vowed to pull the region from opposition into government. Ruto, who had begun enjoying support from regional kingpin Raila Odinga following anti-government Gen Z protests, called on residents to support his government. “[Do] you agree that after three years we should hand over the opposition to other people? Or do you still want the Nyanza region to continue being in opposition? If there are people who want to lead the opposition, let us give it to them,” Ruto said. However, Kibiru maintained that Nyanza cannot be considered fully in government, adding that the Raila-Ruto pact will face its real test approaching the 2027 general election when political realignments take shape. Political analyst Javas Bigambo accused politicians of hijacking Gen Z protests to advance selfish interests and divert the initial agenda of calling for good governance and accountability. “Politicians are now exerting their own influence in the protests, whether they are from the government side or the opposition side. The cause that Gen Z started has been stopped and replaced with another by the political class,” Bigambo said. According to Bigambo, the Mt Kenya region hasn’t been driven to opposition by virtue of not being in government. “The government belongs to everybody, despite who they voted for and as long as they are paying taxes. The Constitution does not have a provision for opposition anywhere. It only creates majority and minority sides. So we don’t have opposition in Kenya,” he said. He cautioned that leaders categorising regions as opposition or government territory likely exacerbates community tensions, fuelling animosity that makes protests more violent. “It is not right to say that some people should be in a government and others in opposition. That creates the perception of us versus them mentality,” Bigambo emphasised. With politicians positioning themselves to garner support from the party-less Gen Z by diverting their governance calls to serve political interests, Bigambo warned the country is heading towards a season of turmoil. “We are finding ourselves in a very volatile state of politics – politics that is fragile. And already it is pointing to very serious violence or potential violence in 2027,” he said. Citing violence during youth-led protests, Bigambo faulted the political class for failing to order sobriety among youthful supporters, resulting in economic crimes. “As young people are pushing for social justice and accountability, other rogue elements have been infiltrating the demonstrations to loot, cause mayhem among well-meaning protesters and burn buildings. They are no longer operating within the realm of law,” he said. He called on government institutions to crack down on the masterminds of the new Gen Z protest phase, likely to spur civil strife ahead of the 2027 elections. “The inciters and some financiers of all these destruction and mayhem must be apprehended and even charges pressed against them in the courts of law,” Bigambo said. During Monday’s running battles between police and protesters, claims emerged that demonstrators had been sponsored to cause chaos and loot businesses. In major Murang’a urban centres, residents reported seeing unfamiliar faces from early morning, suspected of being “hired” to cause chaos. Allegations surfaced of pro-government leaders distributing money for mobilisation to bring more youth to the streets. Acting Central Regional Commissioner Joshua Nkanatha, who doubles as Murang’a county commissioner, said police are investigating the matter. “This is something we are also going to investigate to establish if we had people from outside who had been ferried to this area,” he said. Massive property destruction, deaths, and scores of injuries characterised the regional demonstrations. Police continued chasing protesters in running battles on the outskirts of Murang’a town past midnight Monday. Nkanatha assured residents that security agents would track down all those involved in looting and property destruction. “People will learn to respect the law and we will make sure we nab all the culprits involved in the destruction of property,” he said. “The police did a good job in controlling the demonstrators because the damage could have been more intense.” Kangema MP Peter Kihungi claimed the area’s first-ever protests were led by outsiders. He said goons had been mobilised by someone from within the area, initially targeting businesses before turning to vandalising market construction materials and later moving to the police station. “In the process, two people were shot dead, and I want to tell those doing this to know they won’t rise to power using the blood of the people,” said Kihungi. “The area was very peaceful since morning and these people came in the evening, which indicates someone sent them.” Four people were shot dead during the Murang’a protests – two from Kangari in Kigumo and two from Kangema – along with scores of civilians and police officers injured. Health Director James Mburu said two patients were recuperating in the ICU in stable condition. Annabel Njambi, proprietor of County Supermarkets, said the destruction was clearly planned, with looters having a dress code for identification. “I identified one of the team leaders who was a former employee and she was the one directing them on what to do, which clearly indicates they were on a mission and someone had sent them,” said Njambi."
People Daily,"Families of Saba Saba demos victims seek support, justice",https://peopledaily.digital/news/families-of-saba-saba-demos-victims-seek-support-justice,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 02:20 AM","The families of those who died during the Saba Saba protests yesterday gathered at the City Mortuary to identify the bodies of their loved ones and demanded justice following the killing of their loved ones. Among those killed is 25-year-old man Elvis Musavi, and Peter, 37, who were allegedly shot by police, re-igniting outrage over police brutality. According to Faith Indechi, mother to Elvis, his son just left home like any other day but he did not make it back alive. “He was my first-born child. Yesterday, he left for work in the morning. When he came back, I was called, and when I arrived at where he was, he was already dead,” she said through sobs. Indechi, a single mother from Kangemi, said Elvis was brutally murdered with bullet injuries in the arm and another that penetrated through the back. “I raised him alone, paid his school fees. Now he’s no more and I don’t know how anyone can help me. Even my family lives far away. I’m begging for help from anyone,” she said, pleading for support to transport her son’s body back home for burial. According to the family, police officers brought the body to the mortuary after collecting it from the chief’s office and police station in Kangemi. “Today we have come to confirm, and yes, it is true. He is dead, and there is no way we can bring him back to life,” Indechi added. Peninah Mwikali, the mother to Jeremiah Oscar, 24, one of the victims who died in Ngong, also confirmed that his son died while coming back from work. “My son was coming from the garage to fix his boda boda when he was shot in the neck by a sniper. He was rushed to the hospital. Right now, I have confirmed that my child is dead. He has left behind a wife and two children,” Mwikali explained amid cries. Human rights activists joined the grieving families to condemn what they called blatant extrajudicial killings. Hussein Khalid of Voice Africa, speaking outside the mortuary, confirmed that both Elvis and Peter were shot in Kangemi during the protests. Khalid is calling on the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to immediately investigate the shootings and prosecute those responsible. Khalid accused the government of enabling the killings and openly defending the use of excessive force by police officers. “Murkomen said last week that police have the authority to shoot and kill. This is being done with full knowledge of the authorities. But no one is above the law. We must get justice for the victims,” he said. Activists are working closely with the families of those killed on Monday, to ensure evidence is collected to follow up on justice. They are also pushing for the post-mortem reports so that the families can move forward with the burial planning “We’ve met families of the dead at the city mortuary and Ngong hospital. At the city mortuary, there are 5 bodies and at Ngong Hospital, 3 bodies. These 8 bodies are recorded as deaths from the protests,” Khalid said. Speaking in a different event, Chief Justice Martha Koome, while not directly addressing the Kangemi shootings, spoke about the importance of upholding constitutional rights and the need for professionalism in policing during protests. “When our democratic fabric is tested through waves of public protests. We must maintain a balance between the constitutional right to peaceful assembly and the imperative for people-centred, professional policing,” Koome said. The CJ urged citizens to demonstrate peacefully and condemned acts of vandalism or destruction. At the same time, she emphasised that police must act with restraint and distinguish between peaceful demonstrators and those committing criminal acts. “Police must avoid actions that could cause unnecessary harm or loss of life,” she said, adding that those who infiltrate protests to incite violence should be processed through the justice system. The latest killings have added to growing tensions in the country, as protesters, many of them youth, continue to take to the streets to voice grievances ranging from the end of police brutality, accountability and poor governance. Many citizens are airing their grievances and they are also increasingly sounding the alarm over the government’s heavy-handed response, which they say is unconstitutional and endangers lives. As the bodies of those who fell during the Saba Saba protest, including Elvis and Pete,r lie in the City Mortuary, their families await answers and justice and are seeking assistance from anyone during this hard time."
People Daily,"Tension grips Baringo village after KFS officer shoots, injures teenager",https://peopledaily.digital/news/tension-grips-baringo-village-after-kfs-officer-shoots-injures-teeenager,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 02:00 AM","Apprehension has gripped the sleepy village of Kapchepkokel in Saimo Soi Ward, Baringo County, yesterday morning after a Kenya Forest Service (KFS) officer allegedly shot a teenage boy in the chest under unclear circumstances. The bullet pierced through his lower chest and exited through the back, causing severe bleeding that required an urgent blood transfusion. Robert Kulei, one of the first people to arrive at the scene, said he received a call at around 7 am from area Assistant Chief Richard Cheboi, who claimed that 17-year-old Victor Keino had been injured by a piece of wood and needed immediate medical attention. “I rushed to the scene and found Keino lying in a pool of blood beside the road, while two armed KFS guards stood a few meters away whispering to each other,” said Kulei. He added that the visibly shaken officers insisted the teenager had been impaled by a piece of wood in his lower right torso. “They emphasised that I should tell the medical team the injury was caused by wood, but there was no doubt in my mind what had caused the gaping wound.” According to Kulei, the bullet appeared to have entered just below Keino’s right breast and exited from his back. As they prepared to rush him to the hospital on a motorbike, Keino reportedly whispered faintly, “Kindly take care of my mother if I die from the gunshot wound.” “This broke my heart into a million pieces. I didn’t know what to tell him,” said a distraught Kulei. Keino was first taken to Kabartonjo Sub-County Hospital and later referred to Baringo County Referral Hospital (BCRH) for specialised treatment. While receiving a blood transfusion, Keino told People Daily in a whisper that the KFS officer shot him at close range without provocation. “I have no idea why he did this. I was just going about my business, my panga in hand, like I always do in the morning while searching for pasture for my mother’s cows,” he said. Keino, the youngest in his family, lives with his widowed mother and plays a vital role in helping her with daily chores and livestock care. Despite experiencing chest pains and fluctuating blood pressure, the Standard Eight dropout vowed to fight for his life—for the sake of his mother. His uncle, Zakayo Ruto, strongly condemned the shooting, calling it uncalled for and inhumane. “They wanted to kill him in cold blood,” he said. “Even if he was cutting trees, that’s no reason to shoot. They should have confiscated the trees or arrested him,” Ruto said."
People Daily,Karua: Ruto illegally pushed out IEBC team to derail elections,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/karua-ruto-illegally-pushed-out-iebc-team-to-derail-elections,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 11:12 PM","People’s Liberation Party (PLP) leader Martha Karua has gone bare-knuckle at President William Ruto, accusing him of deliberately engineering a leadership crisis at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to delay the 2027 General Elections. Speaking during a local TV interview on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, Karua claimed the president illegally forced out IEBC commissioners to cripple the commission and manipulate the electoral process in his favour. “If Ruto wants us to meet him at the ballot, let him change his ways. He and his illegitimate rogue regime. If not, Kenyans have the power to terminate your contract earlier,” Karua stated. She went on to say that the president intentionally created a leadership vacuum at the IEBC by pushing out commissioners whose terms were still valid. “Ruto deliberately and illegally pushed out IEBC commissioners whose tenure would still have been valid to delay the process. It is not right that all commissioners go at the same time and we are left without IEBC. That is why there was a broken down hiring,” she added. Karua also took issue with the handling of the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) process, blaming it for wasting time without yielding real results. “If you remember the NADCO report, which I was against, they took one year discussing, they have taken more than a year in legislation in Parliament, and now the commissioners are yet to be appointed properly because he appointed them against a court order. It is deliberate,” she said. Her remarks come at a time when the IEBC is deep in crisis, with serious concerns about its readiness to manage the upcoming general elections. The commission has been operating without a chairperson or commissioners since the resignation of the Cherera Four and the retirement of former Chair the late Wafula Chebukati, alongside commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye. On June 10, 2025, President Ruto appointed seven new commissioners, including Chairperson Erastus Ethekon. However, their swearing-in was blocked by a court order after several petitions challenged the legality of the selection process. Petitioners argued that the appointments were not inclusive, lacked transparency, and failed to meet constitutional requirements such as gender balance and representation of minorities and persons with disabilities. A High Court ruling expected on July 10 will determine whether the appointments will stand or be nullified. The commission’s operations have also stalled due to the absence of leadership. One of the critical issues awaiting attention is the electoral boundaries review, which should have been completed by March 2024. With no commissioners to guide the process, IEBC has turned to the Supreme Court for direction, while Parliament debates the possibility of extending the deadline. Last week, the voter verification system was briefly taken offline without notice. Millions of Kenyans were unable to check their registration. Financial troubles have worsened the commission’s challenges. While the IEBC had requested Ksh61.7 billion for its operations, the National Treasury approved only Ksh57.38 billion, leaving a funding gap of over Ksh4.3 billion. The commission is also struggling with debts amounting to more than Ksh3.7 billion from unpaid suppliers and past by-elections. These shortfalls threaten to undermine its ability to conduct voter registration, procure materials, and plan logistics ahead of 2027."
People Daily,Amisi: Our generation must reject tribalism and bad governance,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/amisi-our-generation-must-reject-tribalism-and-bad-governance,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 05:56 PM","Saboti MP Caleb Amisi has urged the current generation to break away from tribal politics, saying it is a practice rooted in the past and has no place in modern leadership. In a statement posted on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, Amisi emphasised that Kenya’s youth must focus on building a united nation rather than clinging to ethnic identities. According to him, the younger generation no longer identifies people by their tribal background but sees the country as one indivisible nation with a shared purpose. “Tribal politics is for our parents. We are beyond tribes. We don’t know who a Kikuyu, a Luo, a Kalenjin, a Luyha, a Giriama, a Maasai, a Somali, etc., is. All we know is that we are one indivisible nation called Kenya, striving to protect, preserve, respect, and honour God’s creation within our humble 582,646 square km territory. We shall not inherit bad governance and tribalism. We must choose at least one struggle,” Amisi said. He underscored the need to preserve the country’s values and honour the responsibility of leadership through unity, respect, and good governance. In his view, young people must refuse to inherit both tribalism and poor leadership and instead choose a path that uplifts the nation. Amisi’s remarks come at a time when youth across the country are increasingly vocal about political accountability, pushing for a future that prioritises national identity over ethnic affiliations. In a separate tweet, the lawmaker continued with his call for an end to tribalism, condemning the onslaught directed against Mt Kenya communities. Earlier on, Caleb Amisi criticised the former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua for what he termed strategic political missteps that, in his view, weakened his influence and allowed President William Ruto to tighten control within Central Kenya. In a post shared on X on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, Amisi said Gachagua’s biggest mistake was “to abuse, ignore, and chastise MPs and other experienced leaders from Central.” According to Amisi, this approach pushed key leaders away and gave President Ruto the opportunity to work with them and sway the Kikuyu community in his favour. “Now, Ruto has used them effectively to carry on his narrative from within. Pitting Kikuyus against Kikuyus,” Amisi wrote, adding that had Gachagua embraced those leaders early on, they might have helped him build support against the president. MM"
People Daily,Havi hails Maraga amid rising momentum for 2027 presidential bid,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/havi-hails-maraga-amid-rising-momentum-for-2027-presidential-bid,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 03:31 PM","As former Chief Justice David Maraga’s 2027 presidential bid gains traction, lawyer Nelson Havi has once again come out in strong support of his leadership. Speaking on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, Havi praised Maraga’s tenure at the helm of the Judiciary, describing his record on accountability and governance as firm and unshaken. He pointed to Maraga’s bold decision to urge Parliament to impeach former President Uhuru Kenyatta for violating the Constitution and disobeying a court order to appoint 41 judges, terming it a defining moment in Kenya’s constitutional history. “David Maraga’s accountability and good governance track record is undoubted. As Chief Justice, David Maraga boldly implored Parliament to impeach President Uhuru Kenyatta for violating the Constitution and disobeying an order directing the President to swear in 41 judges.” Havi says. This is not the first time Havi has vouched for Maraga’s leadership beyond the Judiciary. He has been consistent in calling on Kenyans to elect Maraga as president, often citing his unwavering commitment to the rule of law and integrity in public service. Recently Nelson Havi came to the defence of Maraga after he came under heavy criticism over his participation in the Wednesday, June 25, protest in the city. Speaking in defence of his learnt colleague, Havi called out those opposed to the Chief Justice’s involvement in advocating for good governance in the country, stressing that it is within the purview of his constitutional rights. He specifically called out Speaker Moses Wetang’ula and his deputy, Gladys Shollei, who have come out to attack the retired chief justice. “Wetang’ula and Shollei have realised the significance of alternative good leadership in Maraga. They have seen it in the man. It is why they want to suppress his candidacy for the presidency. That is that they want to demean his resolve. He is a Kenyan and entitled to vie for the presidency of Kenya and entitled to advocate for the rule of law,” he stated. While lauding Maraga for his bold stance, the legal scholar challenged more like-minded people to come out and add their voices to the quest for better leadership. “Maraga has attained wide acceptance from the entire Gen Z. It is imperative that well-meaning individuals like him come out of their comfort zones and push for reforms and good governance, vie for office, and get elected. It is the way we will get leadership from people who don’t take a statement of disapproval from people as hate,” he stated. MM"

His statement reflects growing frustration across the country as citizens, especially the youth, voice their dissatisfaction with President William Ruto’s government and its recent alliance with opposition leader Raila Odinga. “2027 is to UNINSTALL this trial version of BOTTOM-UP! And DELETE nusu MKATE!! Wantam👉 siku ZOTE,” Buzeki wrote in a post shared on X, on Tuesday, July, 8, 2025. His remarks come at a time of growing public debate around President William Ruto’s deal with the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) led by Raila Odinga. Initially introduced during the 2022 election campaign, the Bottom-Up agenda was presented as a framework to empower low-income earners and small-scale traders. However, three years into the administration, critics argue that the promise has not translated into tangible economic relief. Rising taxes, including fuel levies and deductions for housing and health insurance, have added financial strain on many households. Buzeki’s use of the phrase “nusu mkate,” or “half loaf,” also appeared to reference past power-sharing arrangements, particularly the 2008 coalition government formed after a disputed presidential election. In recent months, some Kenyans have drawn comparisons between that arrangement and the March 2025 agreement that brought ODM figures into cabinet positions. While government officials have defended the partnership as a step toward national unity, some opposition voices and civil society leaders have raised concerns about weakening political accountability. Siaya Governor James Orengo, among others, has criticised the coalition as undermining the opposition’s role. The dissatisfaction has also been visible on the streets, with youth-led protests erupting in 2024 and continuing into 2025. Demonstrators have called for better governance, transparency, and a reduction in the cost of living. Human rights groups have reported dozens of deaths related to the protests and raised alarm over the use of excessive force by police. Although Buzeki does not currently hold an elected position, his comments appear to tap into broader public sentiments as the country looks ahead to the 2027 general election.

People Daily,What next if Kenya misses 2027 polls date?,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/what-next-if-kenya-misses-2027-polls-date,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 02:40 AM","As the clock ticks toward Kenya’s 2027 General Election, a provocative question is unsettling legal minds and ordinary citizens alike: What happens if the country fails to hold elections on the constitutionally mandated date? The question gained traction after President William Ruto’s senior economic adviser, Moses Kuria, made controversial remarks suggesting that Kenya might not hold a General Election in 2027. Kuria pointed to the ongoing legal impasse surrounding the appointment of new members of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), arguing that the 2008 Kriegler Report recommended a fully operational and independent IEBC at least two years ahead of a General Election to guarantee a free and fair process. “In 39 days, the official 24-month countdown to the 2027 elections begins. With our litigious nature, this case could drag all the way to the Supreme Court and beyond – potentially into September 2027,” Kuria warned. His comments reference a court case that has temporarily blocked the swearing-in of IEBC commissioners, despite Parliament clearing them for appointment. Justice Lawrence Mugambi recently ruled that while vetting could proceed, the actual swearing-in remains suspended pending a court decision on the recruitment process’s legality. Kuria’s remarks ignited fierce backlash, with Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka dismissing them as reckless and inflammatory. More controversially, Kuria suggested that if elections aren’t held, the current administration would remain in power beyond its constitutional term, a proposition that has stirred widespread public outrage and heightened legal anxiety. Many voters view Kuria’s comments with suspicion, questioning whether this represents another plan by Ruto to extend his time in office through the back door after parliamentary attempts backfired. “We cannot trust Ruto, especially this coming from his so-called adviser. This is an indication that he could be hatching another scheme to prolong his stay in State House,” explained Wallace John, a Mombasa resident. “Such remarks, coupled with some amendments being introduced intended to gag the media and stifle the democratic rights to picket, smells like a typical Ruto strategy to reinforce his strongman character. But we are telling him he is not lucky, because these days we see and smell from far.” Constitutional and legal experts say Kuria’s remarks expose a critical vulnerability in Kenya’s democratic framework. Mombasa-based advocate Kevin Kamanzi stressed that the IEBC is the only body legally empowered to oversee elections. “If there’s no IEBC, any election conducted by any other body would be illegal – an academic exercise at best. Such a vote would be null and void, and easily challenged in court,” he said. Kamanzi cautioned that the Constitution provides no backup plan for conducting elections without the IEBC. “We are heading for a perfect storm: a legal crisis, a constitutional crisis, and a political crisis,” he said. “With the rising dissatisfaction in the country and growing protest culture, if people can’t exercise their right to vote in 2027, the situation could turn volatile.” Legal analyst Abdulrahman Maghenda agrees, pointing out that while Articles 101 and 136 clearly stipulate that a General Election must be held every five years on the second Tuesday of August, the Constitution is silent on what should happen if elections are not held. “This is uncharted territory. The Constitution outlines when elections should happen, but doesn’t say what to do if they don’t. There’s no fallback mechanism, no indication of who should step in – whether the courts, Parliament, or the President,” Maghenda observed, noting that Kenyans are experiencing firsthand how the country’s constitutional limits are being tested as the elections approach. Davis Lang’at, another advocate in the port city, believes the matter could end up before the courts. “This is a constitutional interpretation issue,” he said. “Since the High Court has inherent jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution, it could be petitioned to provide guidance if it becomes evident that elections cannot be held as scheduled.” Lang’at added that the law is rigid on timelines. “The Constitution doesn’t offer a grace period. There’s no ‘14-day leeway’ as seen in election petition timelines. If elections don’t happen on the exact date, we may plunge into a legal vacuum.” Not everyone buys into the crisis narrative. Kwale County Assembly Speaker Seth Kamanza, a legal expert himself, insists that the Constitution is unequivocal: Elections must be held on the second Tuesday of August 2027, come what may. “The IEBC exists – it’s just not functional yet. The courts must expedite their decision to enable the swearing-in process,” Kamanza said. He admits the new team will work against the clock but argues that there is no legal provision to push the date without a referendum. “Changing the election date or altering presidential term timelines requires a constitutional amendment, which must go through a referendum. You can’t just move the goalpost,” he added. With barely 25 months remaining, Kamanza warns that the IEBC will be swamped with tasks including conducting a national voter audit, cleaning up the voter register, reopening registration, and preparing for the elections. “All this must be done in under two years. Technically, it’s an uphill task, but legally, there’s no choice. The law says the elections must happen,” Kamanza stated. He also pointed out that the new commissioners will inherit a backlog of over 20 pending by-elections, following the deaths of multiple members of county assemblies and other elected leaders. “These commissioners will have to prioritise. They may have no option but to sideline some by-elections to focus on the General Election,” he said. Mombasa-based constitutional lawyer Munira Ali dismissed Kuria’s claims as legally untenable. Speaking in response to the controversial remarks, Ali maintained that the date of the General Election is a constitutional imperative that cannot be altered based on logistical or administrative challenges. “Article 136(2)(a) of the Constitution is very clear — presidential elections shall be held on the second Tuesday in August every fifth year. This is not a guideline; it is a mandatory provision of the law. There is absolutely no room for interpretation or circumstantial postponement,” she said. Ali explained that while the 2008 Kriegler Report offers important recommendations on strengthening Kenya’s electoral processes, it does not carry the force of law. “The Kriegler Report is a policy guide, not a constitutional or statutory framework. It cannot override express provisions of the Constitution,” she said. She noted that in past instances, courts have compelled government organs – including the President, Parliament and the IEBC selection panel – to act swiftly to avert constitutional crises, especially where electoral timelines are at risk. Ali also stressed that while the Constitution allows Parliament to extend its term by up to 12 months during a state of war, there is no such provision for extending the President’s term under any circumstance, not even in wartime. “This means that even in the unlikely event of a war, Parliament can only postpone its term by a year. But there is absolutely no constitutional mechanism to extend the term of a sitting President beyond the five-year limit. If elections are not held, the presidency would be left in a constitutional vacuum,” she said. She added: “The terms of both the President and Members of Parliament are fixed. If elections are not conducted as scheduled, their continued stay in office would be unconstitutional.”"
People Daily,Ruto sanctifies State House as he silences streets,https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/ruto-sanctifies-state-house-as-he-silences-streets,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 01:00 AM","As Kenya approaches the 2027 elections, two controversial developments have ignited public outrage: a Sh1.2 billion church planned for State House and a legislative proposal to severely restrict public demonstrations. To many Kenyans, the initiatives represent a dangerous fusion of sanctimony and suppression – a church rising in the presidential compound even as voices in the streets face silencing. At the centre of public fury is the Public Order (Amendment) Bill, proposed by Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris. The legislation would impose new limitations on protest rights, including a 100-metre restriction from protected zones, expanded police powers, and potential fines and jail time for protest organisers. Nelius Njuguna, legal adviser at Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), argues the proposed law fails constitutional standards. “Applying a blanket law to all protesters does not strike a balance with their constitutional right to assemble, picket, and petition. Banning protests within 100 metres of ‘protected areas’ disproportionately affects citizens who seek visibility by protesting near symbols of power,” Njuguna told People Daily. Constitutional lawyer Charles Kanjama echoes these concerns, calling the bill “an overreaction that threatens fundamental rights and freedoms. Any limitation must be reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society”. Njuguna raises deeper questions about proportionality and necessity: “Are these amendments truly necessary? And are they proportional to the stated aims of public order and safety? I believe there are less restrictive means, such as training police to de-escalate, that would achieve the same objective without infringing rights.” Critics view the proposed changes as reactionary, following recent youth-led anti-government protests over taxes, debt, and joblessness. The fear, they argue, centres not on violence but on dissent itself. “The timing of these proposed amendments, immediately following significant anti-government protests, strongly suggests a reactive rather than proactive legislative move,” Njuguna asserts. “This is not a legitimate legislative effort, it’s a tool to suppress dissent.” Eric Mukoya, executive director of the International Commission of Jurists- Kenya, was more direct, calling the proposal unconstitutional and warning: “We need to remind those in power that they won’t hold office forever. We will gather everything, and once you are out of office, we shall come for you.” While tightening controls on protest, the government is loosening purse strings to build what President Ruto calls a “House of God” within State House grounds. The President defended the plan staunchly: “We want to make State House a place where we can seek God. Kenya must be guided by spiritual values. No taxpayers’ money will be spent. I have no apology to make.” But this gesture, seen by supporters as spiritual symbolism, strikes critics as political theatre – an attempt to sanctify power while distracting from worsening economic conditions. “That is not our priority as Kenyans,” argued economist Fred Ogola. “Ksh1.2 billion could be used to revive the dying sugar sector or education. Ruto should not use religion to conduct unlawful things or marginalise other beliefs.” Njuguna raised constitutional concerns under Article 8, which establishes Kenya as a secular state: “While the President has every right to practice his faith, building a prayer altar in State House, a public institution blurs the line between personal belief and state endorsement. It raises serious concerns about discrimination and exclusion in a multi-faith country.” Already, Muslim leaders have requested space for a mosque, triggering concerns that the State House may transform into a religious complex rather than a seat of national unity. The backlash proves most potent among Kenya’s youth – the very demographic that propelled Ruto’s “hustler” campaign to victory. Jessie Saruni, President of the Kenya Universities Students Organisation (KUSO), accused the President of abandoning the youth agenda: “President Ruto is always out of order. You’re talking about a church when the university funding model is collapsing. Lecturers are poorly paid, [money for the] Higher Education Loan Board (HELB) is insufficient, and some institutions lack even classrooms.” For many young Kenyans, the emphasis on religion feels like a diversion from urgent economic reforms and job creation, deepening perceptions that the regime remains tone-deaf to its own power base. “He has clearly shown that he will not listen to the voice of the youth,” Saruni states. With two years until the next elections, political analysts see both initiatives as consolidation strategies by a regime shaken by recent unrest. “This is political paranoia disguised as moral governance,” remarks Ogola. “The protests rattled the government. Now they’re trying to sanctify power at the centre and neutralise dissent in the streets. It’s spiritual warfare against democracy.” If passed, the public order bill would grant the State sweeping power to regulate or ban demonstrations under the guise of public safety. AM"
People Daily,Rugby Africa Cup: Kenya Simbas edge Uganda to reach semis,https://peopledaily.digital/sports/rugby-africa-cup-kenya-simbas-edge-uganda-to-reach-semis,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 06:50 PM","Kenya Simbas overcame a determined Uganda Rugby Cranes side with a 32-24 victory in the Rugby Africa Cup quarterfinals, booking their spot in the semifinals of the continental tournament. The fierce East African derby lived up to expectations as both teams displayed grit, power, and tactical intensity before a charged crowd at the Mandela National Stadium in Kampala. Kenya made a fast start, nearly scoring within the first minute through a powerful maul, but the referee denied the effort. Minutes later, Griffin Chao broke through Uganda’s left flank to open the scores with a try. However, the conversion went wide, leaving the score at 5-0. The Simbas doubled their lead when Barry Young powered through the defence to touch down under the posts. The successful conversion put Kenya ahead 12-0. Uganda responded well and camped in Kenya’s 22, eventually breaking through to cut the deficit to 12-7 heading into halftime. After the break, Barry Young slotted in a brilliant drop goal, extending Kenya’s lead to 15-10. Thomas Okeyo then added another try for the visitors, with Jone Kubu converting to push the scoreline to 22-10. Kenya continued to dominate as Chao returned with another stunning try from a line-out move. Kubu converted again, taking the score to 29-10. Uganda pushed back, scoring two converted tries and a penalty to narrow the gap to 29-24. But Young had the final say, sealing the game with a late drop goal that brought the final score to 32-24. Despite Uganda’s spirited comeback, the Simbas held on to secure a hard-fought win. Head coach Jerome Paarwater praised his side’s composure and execution in a tense fixture. “It was a tough battle, but the boys stuck to the plan and got the job done.” With the result, the Kenya Simbas advance to the semifinals of the 2025 Rugby Africa Cup, where they will face defending champions Zimbabwe on Sunday, July 13, at the same venue. The fixture promises to be another high-octane clash as the Simbas chase continental glory. WM"

The Ministry of Youth Affairs, Creative Economy, and Sports, through Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya, presented the cheques on Tuesday, celebrating the athletes’ extraordinary achievements in the 1500m and 5000m events, respectively. Speaking at the award ceremony, CS Mvurya lauded the athletes as icons who have taken Kenyan athletics to new heights. “Faith and Beatrice are not just champions; they are game changers who have redefined the sport of athletics across the globe,” he said. “Their performances at the Prefontaine Classic have not only brought pride to Kenya but have also inspired a new generation of athletes.” Kipyegon set a new 1500m world record, clocking an astonishing 3:48.68, shattering the previous records of 3:49.04 (2024) and 3:49.11 (2023). After the race, Kipyegon expressed her pride and determination. “It was tough, but I am so proud of what I’ve done, and I’m going to keep on trying, dreaming, and pursuing big goals. I want to show the world, and especially women, that you have to dare to try,” she stated. Chebet, the Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m champion, also etched her name in the history books by becoming the first woman to run 5,000m in under 14 minutes. She posted a remarkable 13:58.06, breaking the previous record held by Ethiopia’s Gudaf Tsegay. “When I was coming here to Eugene, I was coming to prepare to run a world record,” Chebet said. “I said, ‘If Faith is trying, why not me?’ And today, I’m so happy because I’ve achieved being the first woman to run under 14.” The government’s recognition is part of efforts to motivate and support elite athletes ahead of global competitions, including the upcoming 2025 World Championships.

People Daily,Vincent Otieno: Tusker FC sign midfielder from Nairobi City Stars,https://peopledaily.digital/sports/vincent-otieno-tusker-fc-sign-midfielder-from-nairobi-city-stars,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 02:38 PM","Tusker FC have bolstered their midfield with the signing of Vincent Otieno from Nairobi City Stars. The club confirmed the news on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, through their official social media platforms, posting a graphic of the new recruit with the caption. “We are delighted to announce the signing of midfielder Vincent Otieno, who arrives from Nairobi City Stars. Karibu Oti,” Tusker stated. Otieno, known for his tireless engine and eye for goal, was a standout performer for City Stars last season. He finished as their top scorer in the 2023/24 FKF Premier League campaign with eight goals, impressive numbers for a midfielder. In the 2024/25 FKF Premier League season, Owino was also impressive. The 25-year-old began his football journey at Rongo Youth Club before making stops at Fortune Sacco and FC Talanta. He joined Nairobi City Stars in 2023 and didn’t take long to make his mark, scoring his debut goal against Wazito FC. He added three more during the second leg of the 2022/23 season, underlining his ability to contribute both defensively and in attack. Owino received a call-up to the Kenya national team from head coach Engin Firat for the Central Eastern Zone qualifiers of the 2024 African Nations Championship in the final quarter of 2024. He made his senior debut with a brief appearance in the first leg of the opening round against South Sudan, held at Juba Stadium on October 27, 2024. Tusker are clearly looking to build on last season’s second-place finish. With the new season looming, the Brewers are gearing up for another title challenge, and Otieno’s arrival could be a key piece of the puzzle. His signing follows hot on the heels of defender Dennis “Decha” Wanjala, who also last year joined from City Stars, signalling that Tusker means business this transfer window. Otieno brings energy, creativity, and a knack for timely goals, qualities that could prove vital as Tusker eye the title and prepare to battle heavyweights like Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards. In the 2024/25 FKF Premier League season, Tusker finished fourth with 57 points, behind champions Kenya Police FC (65 points), Gor Mahia (59 points), and Kakamega Homeboyz (58 points). The Brewers last won the FKF Premier League title in the 2021/22 season, securing their 13th league crown. Kenneth Mwenda is a digital writer with over five years of experience.

Matharu, playing off handicap 2, carded an impressive 72 gross to secure the Overall Gross Winner (Men) title, while Gichigi, playing off handicap 7, took top honours in the ladies’ category with 86 gross in one of the most hotly contested rounds of the series so far. The day saw at least 260 golfers from across the region brave cold weather to compete in a variety of divisions, all eyeing a coveted slot at the Grand Finale slated for November at Muthaiga Golf Club. Division One (handicap 5-12) witnessed a strong showing from Saahil Shah (handicap 10), who posted 40 points to clinch the title and also walked away with the Longest Drive award among the men, underlining a fine all-round display. In Division Two (handicap 13-24), Milan Varsani (handicap 18) emerged victorious among the men with 42 points, while Jane Njau (handicap 14) led the ladies with 33 points. Jane also topped the Longest Drive contest among female golfers. The Division Three title (handicap 25 and above) went to Bharat Lakhani, who registered the day’s highest stableford score, 43 points, to win the category. Among guest players, Tonny Tugee (handicap 12) stood out with 38 points. Other accolades included Nearest to the Pin honours, which went to William Moturi and Mukami Wachira in the men’s and ladies’ categories respectively. Speaking during the prize ceremony, NCBA Bank’s ABC Place Branch Manager Rose Mburu applauded the spirited turnout and reaffirmed the bank’s commitment to regional golf development. “Golf remains a key priority for NCBA. This year alone, we have allocated over KES 60 million to support golf initiatives in East Africa,” she said. “We believe the sport builds character, unites communities, and inspires across all levels.” The NCBA Golf Series now heads to Rwanda on July 13 before returning to the Kenyan coast for the Mombasa Golf Club leg on July 22, as players across the region continue their quest for Series glory."

The 24-year-old, who is predominantly a wing-back, has spent the last two seasons in Sky Bet League One with Exeter City. He played 65 times in total for the Grecians and contributed three goals and three assists during his time at St James Park. Speaking after putting pen to paper, Harper said, “I’m happy to finally get it all sorted and I’m looking forward to getting started. Speaking to the gaffer and what he’s got planned sold it to me, and playing here at the start of last season, I liked the vibe and the atmosphere, so when it came about, I wanted to get involved straight away. I’m energetic, I like to defend, and I like to attack. I’m nice and dynamic, and I like to have fun on the pitch. I want to do the best I can and help the team win games.” Walsall head coach Mat Sadler was thrilled to secure Harper’s services, “Vincent is a very explosive wing-back with a very athletic profile. He’s quick, and likes to get at his man, but he’s a very good one-v-one defender as well. He comes to us on the back of a lot of games in League One last season for Exeter, so it’s a very important signing for us. He’s someone we’ve worked on for quite some time in the off-season, and he was highly sought after by a lot of clubs in our division.” The Kenyan began his career at Bristol City and made his first steps in senior football with loan spells at Gloucester City, Weston-super-Mare, and Bath City. He left Ashton Gate at the end of the 2020-21 season and moved to Chippenham Town, but after just under a month there, he was approached by National League side Eastleigh. He spent two seasons with the Spitfires, where he excelled. Harper netted four times during the 2022-23 season, and his impressive performances caught the eye of Exeter, who signed him for an undisclosed compensation fee. In October 2023, he was called up to the Kenya squad and was on the bench for a friendly against Russia."

The Nyali Golf and Country Club’s ace wrapped up with an 18-under-par 274 (66, 69, 68, 71), claiming the title and a cash prize of Ksh201,000. He made a total of six birdies in the fourth round (at holes 2 and 8) before switching gears on the back nine, sinking four consecutive birdies between the 13th and 16th. Despite the positive score, Nduva told People Sports he failed to replicate the previous round’s back-to-back eagles at holes 13 and 14. “I was very positive I would seal my victory on the back nine, which I’m proud of, but I missed crucial opportunities to hit my 21-under-par target, including holes 13 and 14, where I made two eagles yesterday. Still, four birdies in a row were good enough to give me the win, and I promise there’s more to come,” said Nduva, just a fortnight before the second leg set to be hosted by Limuru Golf and Country Club. Runner-up David Wakhu, who finished at 16-under-par 276 (70, 67, 68, 71), credited his strong performance to his role at the recent 16th CISM World Military Golf Championship held in Diani. “Today I had fun because I was well-prepared after training hard with Team Kenya as their head coach for the CISM championship. We had more time to grind, and it paid off. Next up, I want to go one better and win a title in the upcoming PGK Equator events,” Wakhu told People Sports. Wakhu pocketed Ksh165,000, while Njoroge Kibugu, John Karichu, and Eric Ooko earned Ksh112,500, Ksh105,000 and Ksh95,000 respectively for finishing third, fourth and fifth. PGK chairman CJ Wangai expressed optimism that the Equator Tour will act as a gateway to Olympic representation. “It’s the first time in history we’ve had an under-par cut, and I’m confident that at this pace, we will have a Kenyan golfer feature at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and possibly a Kenyan pro win the Magical Kenya Open in one of the next few editions,” said Wangai. Meanwhile, junior golfer Junaid Manji from Sigona Golf Club earned admiration from both fans and professionals after finishing ninth with a 4-under-par 288 (69, 72, 76, 71)."
People Daily,"Kakamega High snubs Musingu rematch, says replay ruling defies KSSSA Constitution",https://peopledaily.digital/sports/kakamega-high-snubs-musingu-rematch-says-replay-ruling-defies-ksssa-constitution,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 03:20 AM","Drama rocked the Kakamega County Secondary School Championship on Saturday after Kakamega High School’s Green Commandos refused to honour a scheduled rematch against Musingu Boys, citing constitutional violations, lack of official communication as well as an unresolved appeal before the KSSSA Supreme Jury. Green Commandos, through head coach Samuel Oindo, stated that it had not received any formal communication regarding the rematch and that they are still awaiting a ruling from the KSSSA Supreme Jury on their appeal. “We did not appear at Nyang’ori because we contested the jury’s ruling. We were not satisfied with the verdict, especially regarding Article 14(e) of the KSSSA Constitution on player eligibility. That’s why we appealed to the Supreme Jury and are now waiting for their decision,” said Oindo. He added that they received no official information regarding the rematch and only learned about it through social media. According to Oindo, the decision to stage a rematch is not supported by the KSSSA Constitution, which clearly states that if a team is found to have fielded ineligible players, the outcome is a disqualification. Not a replay. The controversy follows a Ministry of Education circular dated July 4, 2025, signed by County Director of Education Hellen Nyang’au, declaring that both Kakamega and Musingu fielded ineligible players in violation of KSSSA rules. The ruling stripped Musingu of the county championship title, demoted Kakamega from third place and ordered a rematch to determine new standings. But according to Kakamega High School, no formal appeal was filed against them by Musingu. The school maintains that all their players are registered Form Four students, verifiable via KNEC records. They insist the ruling is not only unfair but also constitutionally flawed. Kakamega School’s Games Master, Amos Wamanga, expressed frustration over what he termed a history of bias against the school. “We received the ruling on Friday evening, and frankly, the communication was unclear. We could not in good conscience accept a rematch. This is not just about qualifying for regionals; it’s about restoring sanity and fairness in school sports,” said Wamanga. He likened the situation to the biblical story of two women fighting over a child. “It reminds me of the story where one woman was okay with the child being cut in two. That’s what Musingu is doing, embracing a flawed decision. We won’t let our boys suffer. The child is ours and we won’t allow it to be split.” Wamanga cited the KSSSA Constitution, specifically Article 14(e) and Section 17 (1, 2, 3), which state clearly that any team found fielding overage or ineligible players must be disqualified and banned. “The Constitution is clear. A team fielding ineligible players must be disqualified and banned. Nowhere does it allow for a rematch,” he added. Vice Chair of the Kakamega High School Alumni Team Abbas Keya backed the school’s decision to reject the rematch. “We’ve supported this team for years, and what’s happening is injustice. We played the county games under protest. This isn’t about fear; it’s about fairness. We want integrity in school sports. Musingu has a history of fielding ineligible players.” Keya further questioned the process that led to the jury’s ruling. “Musingu never appealed against us. So how did we end up being punished? Who appealed against Kakamega? Was it the county jury? Why?” posed Keya."

Following the conclusion of the quarterfinal ties, Kenya Prisons joined General Service Unit (GSU), Kenya Defence Forces (KDF), and Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) in the Final Four of the men’s category. Prisons’ men’s volleyball team booked their spot in the Kenya Cup semifinals after a dominant straight-sets victory over Equity Bank. The Wardens edged the bankers with scores of 25-20, 25-20, and 25-23. GSU volleyball team, on their part, secured their place in the semifinals after a thrilling 3-1 victory against the Kenya Airport Police Unit (KAPU).

People Daily,Musingu stripped of title in age cheating scandal,https://peopledaily.digital/sports/musingu-stripped-of-title-in-age-cheating-scandal,"Monday 07th July, 2025 08:20 AM","Storm is brewing in Kakamega’s school football scene after defending champions Musingu Boys High School were stripped of their county title for fielding overage players against archrivals Kakamega School. This move has sparked fresh allegations of fraud, legal petitions and the suspension of regional games amid a deepening crisis in Kenya’s secondary school sports. The school now faces possible sanctions from the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSA). Musingu beat Kakamega School on penalties and went on to win the county boys’ football trophy with a 2-0 drubbing of Butere Boys in the final held at the Mumias Sports Complex a fortnight ago. However, their search for football glory (their first since 1984) has come under scrutiny for alleged deceit during the county games. On Friday, July 4, 2025, the county jury upheld an appeal and protest lodged by Kakamega School, citing the eligibility of four Musingu players who were later found to be overage. KSSA rules cap the age limit for participants at 19 years and prescribe a two-year ban for any school found culpable of violating eligibility guidelines. Players born after September 1, 2005, are ineligible to compete in the 2025 school games. The jury found that Musingu fielded four overage players, stripped them of the county title and awarded it to Butere Boys. However, in a surprise twist, the jury, chaired by county director of education Hellen Nyang’au, bent the rules, sparing Musingu from both disqualification and a ban, and instead ordered a rematch against Kakamega School. The verdict, signed by Nyang’au, claimed Kakamega School was equally guilty of fielding ineligible players in the same match, an allegation Kakamega School principal Dr Julius Mambili vehemently denied. “We’re pursuing this matter to restore sanity in school games. If indeed Kakamega fielded ineligible players, the honourable thing is to ban us,” Dr Mambili said."
People Daily,Why Kenya should ramp up investments in creative sector,https://peopledaily.digital/business/why-kenya-should-ramp-up-investments-in-creative-sector,"Wednesday 09th July, 2025 01:00 AM","Kenya has a golden opportunity to tap into the booming global creative economy and reduce its heavy reliance on traditional exports like tea, coffee, and horticulture. A new United Nations report shows that the global demand for creative goods and services is rising fast—and Kenya has the raw talent to benefit if it acts now. According to the Creative Economy Outlook 2024, global exports of creative services reached $1.4 trillion in 2022, with creative goods adding another $713 billion. That’s a 29 per cent and 19 per cent increase respectively since 2017. These numbers show a major shift in how people around the world are spending—moving away from physical goods to creative content like design, digital media, advertising, and visual arts. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which released the report, noted that creative industries are not only reshaping global trade but also changing how jobs are created and who benefits. This is especially important for countries like Kenya, where many young people are unemployed despite having access to the internet, smartphones, and artistic talent. The creative economy includes music, film, design, fashion, video games, software development, publishing, and performing arts. In Kenya, all these sectors are growing. From YouTube comedians to TikTok dancers, from Nairobi-based animators to filmmakers shooting documentaries in Kibera, Kenyans are already participating in the global creative scene. But the country lacks the right policies and investments to help these talents thrive. “Digital transformation is profoundly impacting the production and consumption of creative goods and services, generating opportunities for some and challenges for others,” the report notes. This shift is particularly significant for countries like Kenya, where traditional export earnings from tea, coffee, and horticulture are facing stiff global competition and price volatility. One clear example is the music industry. Kenyan musicians are gaining international fans, especially through platforms like Spotify and Boomplay. Yet, many of them struggle to earn fair income because of weak copyright protections and poor access to global markets. Artists like Sauti Sol and Khaligraph Jones have broken through, but for every success story, there are hundreds of artists who quit because they can’t make ends meet. The same applies to film. Kenya produces exciting content, with filmmakers gaining recognition at global film festivals. Yet, limited government support, expensive equipment, and piracy remain serious obstacles. Nigeria’s Nollywood has grown into a billion-dollar industry with strong local and diaspora support—Kenya can learn from that model. Fashion is another promising area. Kenyan designers like Anyango Mpinga and brands like KikoRomeo have showcased their work in international fashion shows. Locally-made clothing inspired by African prints and urban youth culture is gaining popularity worldwide. But scaling up production, accessing export markets, and protecting intellectual property remain big challenges. The UN report points out that the creative economy offers more than profits. It can help promote sustainable development, create jobs for young people, and empower women and marginalised communities. Importantly, it also helps to preserve and share cultural heritage. Digital technology plays a key role in this transformation. Social media, streaming platforms, mobile apps, and cloud-based tools have made it easier for creatives to reach global audiences. But technology also brings challenges. Many African creatives face digital barriers like poor internet connectivity, limited digital skills, and lack of e-commerce support. They also need protection from exploitation by big platforms that benefit from their content but offer little pay. UNCTAD’s data shows that developing countries like Kenya are starting to catch up. In 2010, they contributed just 10 per cent of global creative services exports. By 2022, that had doubled to 20 per cent. With the right investment in infrastructure, education, and policy reforms, Kenya can join the frontrunners. At a UNCTAD conference in Geneva, experts discussed how to ensure that digital tools like artificial intelligence don’t replace human creativity but instead support it. The goal is to build an inclusive creative economy that supports artists, protects intellectual property, and promotes local culture. “As a driver of sustainable development, the creative economy requires continued policy attention and investment to maximise its positive societal impact,” said Marisa Henderson, head of the creative economy programme at UN Trade and Development. To succeed, Kenya needs to do several things. First, invest in education and skills development—especially in digital arts, coding, and creative writing. Second, create fair copyright and data protection laws to protect creators’ rights.  Third, support creative start-ups with access to funding, training, and markets."
People Daily,Trump doubles down on August 1 tariff deadline as stocks continue to dip,https://peopledaily.digital/business/trump-doubles-down-on-august-1-tariff-deadline-as-stocks-continue-to-dip,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 11:43 PM","After a celebratory June, which saw the S&P 500 reach record highs, July is off to a gloomy start. The threat of tariffs looms once again for investors, as President Trump insists he will stand by a new negotiation deadline of August 1 for the bruising campaign of levies that he announced in April. Stocks continued their downward dip from Monday, with the S&P 500 falling 0.07%, driven by modest drops in blue-chip companies like Amazon and Microsoft. And lest wary onlookers hope for another delay, Trump posted on Truth Social that Aug. 1 would be the final opportunity for U.S. trade partners to come to the table, after previously stating the deadline was not “100% firm.” “No extensions will be granted,” he wrote on his social-media platform. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump’s second term in office has been an economic rollercoaster, with stocks falling dramatically after his Liberation Day tariff announcement in April before recovering after he backed off from the steep demands. But even as markets ticked back up, the original extension of July 9 remained as a ticking time bomb. And while Trump signed an executive order on Monday to push the deadline once again to Aug. 1, it wasn’t enough to calm investors. The imminent reciprocal tariffs are not the only expected economic policy from the White House this week, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling CNBC on Monday that it was going to be a “busy couple of days.” On Tuesday, Trump announced a new 50% tariff on copper, though he did not set a date that it would go into effect. To date, the White House has only hammered out deals with Britain and Vietnam, and an expected deal with India remains uncertain. While markets remain jumpy, Trump continues to put pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that Powell should “resign immediately,” once again criticizing the central banker’s decision not to lower interest rates. Powell, however, has cited the potential impact of tariffs on inflation as a reason the Fed has kept rates steady. Despite the volatility, stocks have not fallen as sharply as they did in April when Trump first announced his tariffs campaign, sending markets into a downward spiral. And while his Tuesday post on Truth Social insisted that Aug. 1 would be the last chance for countries to negotiate, he has repeatedly moved the goalposts in the past. One bright spot amid Tuesday’s sea of red was Tesla, which rose 1.33% on Tuesday despite CEO Elon Musk’s public spat with Trump. In a new note on Tuesday morning, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that Tesla has reached a “tipping point,” calling for the board to end the “soap opera.” One of his recommendations was for Musk to reduce his work, including his recent campaign to create a new political party. After Ives posted his demands to X, Musk issued a brief reply: “Shut up, Dan.”"
People Daily,Govt introduces new 4 per cent levy on local and imported sugar,https://peopledaily.digital/business/govt-introduces-new-4-per-cent-levy-on-local-and-imported-sugar,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 08:02 PM","The government has imposed a 4 per cent Sugar Development Levy on all domestically produced and imported sugar, effective from July 1, 2025. The announcement was made on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, through a public notice by the State Department for Agriculture, sparking mixed reactions across the sector. The levy, aimed at revitalising the country’s ailing sugar industry, applies to “every miller and every person who imports sugar,” according to the notice. For locally manufactured sugar, the tax will be calculated based on 4% of the ex-factory price, while imported sugar will attract 4% of the Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) value of each consignment. “The Sugar Development Levy is now in effect from 1st July 2025,” the notice stated. “The levy shall be remitted by the tenth day of the month following the sale or importation.” To manage and enforce compliance, the Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture and Livestock Development has appointed the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) as the official collecting agent. “The KRA will issue a communication advising on the mode of collection,” the ministry noted. The levy is expected to raise critical funds for sugar sector development, including investments in research, infrastructure, and farmer support. In a strong call for accountability, the Principal Secretary urged all stakeholders to play their part in reviving the sugar sub-sector. “We are committed to ensuring that every coin collected through this levy is reinvested back into the sector to benefit farmers,” the PS said. However, some stakeholders have expressed concern over potential price hikes and the impact on manufacturing costs. The ministry assured that measures would be put in place to cushion consumers and prevent exploitation. “All inquiries can be channeled to the State Department for Agriculture or the Kenya Sugar Board,” the notice concluded.

People Daily,Govt denies banning avocado exports,https://peopledaily.digital/business/govt-denies-banning-avocado-exports,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 02:32 PM","The government has dismissed reports suggesting that a ban on fresh avocado exports was being considered, terming the claims as misleading and unfounded. In a statement released on Tuesday, July 8, 2025, the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) clarified that while a meeting with avocado oil processors was held on June 25, 2025, no proposal to ban fresh avocado exports was discussed. The meeting, which was held in conjunction with the Presidential Economic Transformation Secretariat (PETS), focused on enhancing avocado oil production and addressing post-harvest losses. “We note with great concern that misleading information is being circulated among the horticulture industry stakeholders and the public, and that during a meeting, a proposal to ban the export of fresh avocados was discussed. This is not true,” AFA stated. The authority explained that the purpose of the meeting was to ensure that surplus avocados—those not sold locally or exported—are processed into oil. “This was to ensure that all avocados not sold locally or exported are processed for oil, to reduce post-harvest losses,” the statement read in part. AFA further emphasized that Kenya not only continues to export fresh avocado but is actively working to enhance export volumes and access new markets. “The Authority therefore confirms that Kenya shall not only continue to export fresh avocado but is working towards enhancing fresh avocado export volumes and destinations.” In addition, AFA said it is collaborating with county governments to boost avocado production at the farm level. This, they noted, will ensure a sustainable supply for both fresh exports and oil processing. Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura further echoed AFA’s remarks, stating that Kenya remains a top global avocado exporter. “Claims that a ban was discussed during the June 25 meeting are false,” he said, confirming that exports are ongoing. Kenya remains the leading avocado exporter in Africa and among the top six globally. In 2024 alone, the country exported over 119,801 metric tons of avocado valued at Ksh22.27 billion. WM"
People Daily,City Hall targets Ksh5B more from land rates,https://peopledaily.digital/business/city-hall-targets-ksh5b-more-from-land-rates,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 08:20 AM","City Hall is targeting to collect an additional Ksh5 billion from land rates after the County Assembly passed the Nairobi City County Regularisation of Unauthorized Development Bill, 2025. The bill, which is awaiting signing into law by Governor Johnson Sakaja, will help the county include more landowners and developers in the valuation roll. It provides the county with the opportunity to regularise all unauthorised developments that still meet the required standards. Chief Officer for Urban Planning Patrick Onalo yesterday explained that the county is targeting the Eastlands areas of Kasarani, Utawala, Mwiki, Embakasi, Roysambu, Pipeline and other estates with existing unauthorised developments. He further explained that some of the targeted areas have land that originally belonged to land-buying companies or government land that was invaded by squatters, but the ownership has been subject to court proceedings. “All those areas have almost 2 million city residents so with this bill we can bring the owners and developers on board so that they can get approval for the land they subdivided,” he said Most of the owners have been fighting for titles, with the county stating that almost all titles have been issued. “We now want them to submit their building proposals so that we can include them in the valuation roll.” The planning department is expected to carry out a special census of all the buildings and developments in the identified areas. However, all unauthorized development made on any public land will not be regularized. This means all development on existing or proposed roads, railway lines, communications and other civic facilities or public utilities will not be regularised. Unauthorised developments on forest land or river banks and riparian areas as defined by the Environmental Management and Coordination Act will also not be regularised. The land will instead be recovered for its originally intended purpose. Once the bill is passed, an Advisory Committee and Regularisation Technical Committee will be formed, and all owners are expected to receive notices to make applications for regularisation. All plans and documents must be prepared by licensed professionals."
People Daily,Tapping pension funds for infrastructure development,https://peopledaily.digital/business/tapping-pension-funds-for-infrastructure-development,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 06:20 AM","Kenya’s pension market is the third largest in Africa but remains an untapped source of capital for the nation’s long-term development projects, according to insights from the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC). By late 2023, Kenya’s pension assets had reached an impressive over Ksh2.2 trillion, equivalent to more than $17 billion. This substantial asset base places Kenya firmly among the continent’s leading pension markets. It trails only South Africa, which boasts approximately $300 billion in pension assets, and Nigeria, with around $43 billion. Following Kenya, Namibia holds about $16 billion, while both Egypt and Morocco each manage pension assets valued at roughly $8 billion. “Kenya has made notable strides in integrating informal sector workers into pension systems. With roughly 83 per cent of its workforce operating informally, the government has introduced a suite of targeted micro-pension schemes,” AFC says in its State of Africa’s Infrastructure Report 2025. “The Haba Haba scheme, launched in 2019 by the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), allows self-employed individuals to save flexibly via mobile money platforms such as M-Pesa and WhatsApp.” Traditionally, Kenyan pension funds have allocated their investments primarily to conventional financial instruments. These include government securities, listed equities on the stock exchange, and various real estate ventures, aiming for steady returns for their beneficiaries. While these allocations offer stability, they represent a conservative approach to capital deployment. A significant opportunity exists to reorient a larger portion of this capital towards critical infrastructure and industrial projects. Such a strategic shift could provide much-needed long-term financing for key sectors, accelerating national economic growth. This re-focus would align domestic savings directly with Kenya’s development agenda, fostering greater economic self-reliance. “Africa’s allocation structure significantly weakens the developmental impact of long-term savings and amplifies systemic exposure to sovereign credit risk.  Current allocation practices limit participation in real economy sectors—such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and digital services—that are essential for structural transformation and inclusive growth,” AFC lamented. Commercial banks hold the highest amount of capital in Africa at $2500 billion, followed by Insurance companies at $455 billion, then forex reserves held by central banks at $435 billion. Insurance companies hold $320 billion, and public development banks carry $250 billion on their balance sheets, while external reserves stand at $150 billion. Africa does not need to be borrowing large sums of capital from abroad, but can leverage these funds to reduce its exposure to external factors. Kenya has distinguished itself as a leader in Africa by successfully integrating workers from the informal sector into its pension system. This innovative approach addresses a large segment of the population previously excluded from formal retirement savings. The National Social Security Fund’s (NSSF) “Haba Haba scheme” exemplifies this success. The Haba Haba initiative leverages widely used mobile money platforms, notably M-Pesa and WhatsApp, to facilitate convenient pension contributions for informal workers. This technological integration has significantly broadened the reach of pension services, bringing millions into the formal savings net. The ease of access provided by mobile money has been transformative. It has effectively dismantled barriers to entry for many self-employed individuals and small business owners, encouraging consistent savings. This inclusion directly contributes to the substantial growth of Kenya’s overall pension asset base. It also ensures a more secure future for a larger portion of the workforce."
People Daily,Nairobi CBD turns into ghost town as traders keep off over Saba Saba protests,https://peopledaily.digital/business/nairobi-cbd-turns-into-ghost-town-as-traders-keep-off-over-saba-saba-protests,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 04:40 AM","The busy streets of Nairobi Central Business District (CBD) remained deserted on Monday as economic activities stalled following the planned Saba Saba peaceful protests. Drawing lessons from the June 25 protests, most traders on July 6, 2025, were seen enhancing security for their establishments by installing additional steel doors to safeguard their valuables. During the previous week, a significant number of traders were left counting losses that ran into millions marked by vandalism while others in areas such as the busy Koja roundabout also counted losses. Even though national security has been enhanced, traders still opted to temporarily close shop in fear of looters. “We will still participate in the demonstrations. We want to commemorate those who have lost their lives due to the flaws of the government. This is our democratic right, and we shall not be intimidated. We stand firm!” one youth said on an X post on July 6, 2025. While this remains the case, passengers were also stranded across the major roads leading to the CBD as police officers seemingly paralysed the transport sector. Employed Kenyans particularly the civil servants got stranded despite the government communicating that Monday would be a working day just like any other. “Everyone can access the CBD, no one has been denied access as today is a normal working day,” Deputy Inspector General of the Administration Police Service (APS) Gilbert Masengeli said in an interview. The matatu industry, a key player in the economy also got impacted due to the restrictions to access specific points in the nation’s capital. This means that the amount of revenue generated from the sector is likely to fall below the daily Ksh330 million from more than 60,000 Public Service Vehicles (PSVs). “Some of us are servicing loans and we are not able to pay the instalments during such periods, and so we are urging the government and all stakeholders to get into reconciliation to save the country from anarchy,” Albert Karakacha, the chairman of the association, said in a previous engagement. Much as the different revenue streams are set to be impacted by the peaceful protests, traders leveraged on July 6, 2025, to clear sales, contrary to the norm where Sundays are usually considered slow or off days."
People Daily,Hope for truckers as CAK probe exploitation by foreign firms,https://peopledaily.digital/business/hope-for-truckers-as-cak-probe-exploitation-by-foreign-firms,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 01:20 AM","Kenya’s freight industry is staring at a possible power shift that could upend decades of foreign dominance and revive struggling local businesses. A high-stakes investigation by the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) into suspected collusion, market abuse, and vertical integration by multinational shipping and logistics firms has set the stage for a battle over who moves cargo in and out of the country. For the first time in years, local transporters see a genuine shot at reclaiming market share. Despite owning nine out of every 10 trucks on Kenyan roads, domestic firms handle less than 30 per cent of the business flowing through Mombasa Port. The rest is controlled by a tight cartel of foreign firms who not only sail the cargo in but also clear, forward, warehouse, and truck it inland—leaving little room for anyone else. “The authority initiated a screening into the conduct of the ocean freight shipping services, clearing and forwarding services and provision of trucking services in Kenya and multinational corporations such as Bamburi Cement, East Africa Breweries and British American Tobacco in order to establish whether or not the business practises of the players violate the provisions of the Act,” CAK said in a statement. At the centre of the storm are global shipping giants like Maersk, CMA CGM, MSC, and PIL, accused of locking out local competition through exclusive deals and integrated operations. The allegations, filed by the Kenya Transporters Association (KTA) and Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association (KIFWA), suggest that foreign players have built closed ecosystems where contracts, clients, and profits rarely leave their orbit. The investigation, ordered after pressure from Parliament, could be a tipping point for local investors who have spent years watching the market consolidate around multinationals. If the CAK acts on evidence of abuse—such as identical Terminal Handling Charges ($99 for 20ft containers), depot fees ($70), and cleaning costs ($35)—it could dismantle price structures that have favoured large players and drained competitiveness from local firms. Truck owners in regions like Mlolongo, Mariakani, and Eldoret have long complained of being used only when foreign-affiliated firms face capacity shortages. That could change if the probe leads to measures curbing exclusive contracts and unbundling logistics services. Local firms would not only gain fairer access to tenders but also stronger bargaining power and pricing freedom. Shipping multinationals, meanwhile, stand to lose their grip. Companies like Maersk and CMA CGM could be forced to separate their clearing and trucking divisions from their core ocean freight operations. That would cut into their economies of scale and potentially drive up their operating costs, creating a more level field for competitors. The probe has also put non-shipping multinationals under the microscope. Firms like Bamburi Cement, EABL, and BAT are being investigated for awarding logistics contracts in ways that may reinforce anti-competitive behaviour. These corporations, some of Kenya’s biggest importers and exporters, could face regulatory pressure to revise procurement frameworks that systematically exclude local transporters. The consequences go beyond individual companies. If the CAK concludes that there is sufficient evidence of collusion or market abuse, it may issue orders to restructure market practices, remove barriers to entry, and prohibit restrictive contracts. That would reset the rules of engagement and could usher in a more diverse and competitive logistics market. But the stakes are high. In 2023, Maersk alone controlled 35 per cent of container cargo passing through Mombasa Port, with CMA CGM close behind at 25 per cent. These two companies, alongside others, control more than 90 per cent of containerised freight in Kenya. While no single firm meets the legal dominance threshold of 50 per cent, CAK believes their combined power warrants scrutiny under abuse of dominance provisions. For local investors, the investigation has become more than a legal matter—it’s a test of whether Kenya’s economy can finally shake off structural imbalances that have protected large foreign corporations at the expense of homegrown enterprises. Many see echoes of past regulatory failures like the 2019 High Court ruling that struck down a provision of the Merchant Shipping Act meant to curtail shipping lines from operating logistics businesses. This time, however, momentum appears to be with the local firms. KTA and KIFWA are actively supporting the CAK probe by submitting witnesses, financial records, and contract documentation to back their claims. The regulator, for its part, has committed to a full review of pricing practices, vertical integration, consortia arrangements, and market access barriers."
People Daily,How urban expansion has put farmlands under siege,https://peopledaily.digital/business/how-urban-expansion-has-put-farmlands-under-siege,"Monday 07th July, 2025 07:40 AM","Kenya, like the rest of Africa, is set to witness the fastest rate of urban land conversion globally by 2050, with more than 300,000 square kilometres of farmland expected to be transformed into city space. For Kenya, already facing food insecurity and fragile agricultural systems, this shift presents an existential threat to the country’s ability to feed itself. According to a new “Reimagining Global Food System Resilience” report by KPMG, “In Africa, urban land development is expected to outpace all other regions.” The projected loss, roughly the size of Italy, lays bare a growing conflict between food security and rapid urbanisation. In Kenya, the consequences are already visible. As the middle class expands and urban demand for housing rises, land near infrastructure corridors is increasingly being snapped up by developers, often outbidding smallholder farmers. “Economically, food production is rarely the highest and best use for a packet of land,” the report notes, a trend playing out in satellite towns like Kiambu, Machakos, and Nakuru, once agricultural strongholds but now engulfed by housing projects. This conversion is not happening in isolation. Kenya’s agriculture sector remains largely rain-fed, under-mechanised, and overexposed to climate variability. Irrigation accounts for 70 per cent of global freshwater withdrawals, yet KPMG warns that more than half of this is lost to inefficiencies. Kenya’s own experience is telling: the high-profile Galana-Kulalu food security project collapsed under the weight of poor planning, high input costs, and water mismanagement. With global water demand set to overshoot sustainable supply by 40 per cent by 2030, Kenya’s inertia on irrigation reform is no longer tenable. “This is not just about environmental limits. It is about the resilience of entire supply chains,” the report argues. For a country that aims to grow its agricultural exports while feeding a rapidly urbanising population, water inefficiency becomes a liability. At the core of this vulnerability is Kenya’s smallholder economy. Nearly 70 per cent of the country’s agricultural output comes from farmers working on less than a hectare of land. Globally, more than 500 million such farms exist, many in Africa, yet they “frequently capture only a small fraction of the value created along the supply chain,” the report notes. In Kenya, these farmers often lack access to affordable credit, storage infrastructure, and climate-smart inputs, leaving them highly exposed to shocks. While the National Treasury has called for greater private sector participation in climate-smart agriculture, financial institutions have been slow to develop products aligned to regenerative or biodiversity-linked outcomes. “The system is near, or even past, the breaking point,” the report warns, an observation mirrored in data showing farmer incomes stagnating even as food prices soar. Indeed, food availability in Kenya masks deep inequities in access. Despite adequate production in some seasons, the poorest households remain locked into poor-quality diets. In Nairobi’s informal settlements, residents rely on cheap, nutrient-poor staples, even as food inflation continues to outstrip overall inflation. At the same time, post-harvest losses remain staggering, with up to 40 per cent of Kenya’s fruits and vegetables wasted due to insufficient cold storage, poor logistics, and fragmented value chains. “Reducing food loss by just 25 per cent could feed an additional 870 million people annually,” the report observes. For Kenya, where nearly one in three children under five is stunted, such efficiency gains are critical. The report stresses that the overarching takeaway is that food systems can no longer operate in isolation. “Every person and organisation on the planet is inextricably linked to food systems,” it states."
People Daily,The agony of teenage girls forced into early motherhood,https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/the-agony-of-teenage-girls-forced-into-early-motherhood,"Tuesday 08th July, 2025 05:40 AM","Stacy Awuor (not her real name) whispers lullabies as she swings her two-year-old baby gently, and smiles slowly as the baby begins to slowly close her eyes to take the afternoon nap. Moments later, Awuor lays her daughter to sleep on a small, tiny mattress before slowly slipping through a bundle of a few clean clothes to dress up the daughter when she wakes up. Although the episode appears to be a normal interaction between a young mother and her infant in Nyakach, Awuor’s situation is not ordinary. She is among tens of young girls who have been forced into early motherhood and forced to drop out of school after they were defiled in Kisumu. So bad are the incidents that some of the victims claim they were violated by close relatives or people they knew well. This was the case for Awuor, a young mother aged 19, who has now been forced to undertake parental responsibilities at a tender age, without a source of income and with little knowledge of how to take care of an infant. “My life has been affected greatly since I was defiled by someone I knew very well and had been trusted to take care of me and train me on tailoring,” she says. She says her nightmare began when she was in Form One, during the third term and was only 16 years old. At the time, her mother was unable to raise school fees for her education, forcing her to drop out of school. “My mother had been struggling to keep me in school and I had to rely on well-wishers during my first two terms in school. However, as balances grew, I was forced to drop out of school,” she says. As the family pondered their next steps, her mother opted to engage a Kericho-based tailor she knew to train her daughter on tailoring so as to help her set up her own business and help the family that was languishing in poverty. Little did she know that the tailor would turn out to be a sexual predator. “My mother was really struggling to pay for my training. She would pay the amount in small instalments to the person who was training me, but that was never enough for him,” she narrates. She painfully narrates how the man insisted that he must have sex with her, claiming that he would pay for her the Ksh5,000 arrears that her mother had failed to pay. “One day, he just cornered me and defiled me before fleeing the area,” she says. With nowhere else to seek help, Awuor says she travelled back home to be with her mother. She later learnt that she was pregnant as a result of the defilement. After one year, her mother, who kept encouraging her even after her painful ordeal made another effort to take her back to school where she is currently in Form Four, even though she’s still struggling with school fees arrears. But Awuor is not alone. An interview with a number of survivors of defilement in the Nyakach area, in Kisumu County, unearthed how several young girls who have been forced into motherhood through defilement are picking themselves up. It is a journey fraught with several challenges as they struggle to overcome the painful experiences they went through at the hands of abusers. In the same village, Linda Achieng, 16, who dropped out of school at Grade Seven, is living in agony as her dreams of going back to school fade with each passing day. The teenager is a mother to a nine-month-old infant. When we caught up with her, she was busy breastfeeding her child but appeared to be in distress. She has lost close friends and relatives and is struggling to raise up her child. “It is not easy for me. I was hoping to return to school, but my aunt says she cannot leave her work to look after my child when I am in school,” she says. She says she was attacked by a man who was working for their neighbour as a herdsman. The man was a well-known figure in the village and always presented himself as a humble neighbour. Achieng says the man targeted her when she went to weed their farm and dragged her into an abandoned house where he defiled her. While writhing in pain as the man forced himself on her, she tried to scream but the perpetrator told her not to even report the matter to anyone, including the aunt she was staying with. A few days later, again, while on the farm, the same man came back and defiled her again and warned her against telling anyone. She however reported the incident to her aunt but the perpetrator denied committing the act when he was asked. And when he heard that he was about to be arrested, he fled from the homestead. She however says that the perpetrator came back after a few weeks but no action was taken against him despite the sexual assault he committed on her. “He came with his wife and pleaded with my aunt to forgive him and that they should not pursue the case through the courts. I feel so bad when I see him roaming freely around,” she says. Aside from the pain of seeing her abuser roaming freely in the village, she confesses that she tears down every day as she sees her age mates going to school as she struggles to raise a child. She says she cannot even afford diapers for her child or even clothes. “Every day is a major struggle. I have been crying myself to sleep on most days, but there is nothing much I can do but just be a mother to my child,” she says. The plight of the young mothers is made worse by the lack of safe houses to accommodate young girls subjected to sexual assaults and women grappling with Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Nyanza. In Kisumu County, for instance, several efforts to build safe houses to accommodate victims of GBV have never seen the light of the day, with survivors forced to rely on private facilities. According to Senator Catherine Mumo, GBV is not only a problem of Nyakach and Kisumu County but a national problem, and everyone in all sectors must be involved in tackling the menace. “We have lost against defilement, rape, physical and emotional abuse and for some reason or another, the country is going on an overdrive against matters relating to GBV,” she says. She adds that good evidence that GBV is rampant is the high number of teenage pregnancies in Kenya. According to her, globally, Kenya is third in teenage pregnancies, while Kisumu County leads in HIV infections. “Majority of these cases are girls aged between 10 and 19 years, which is a sign that inappropriate sexual activities are happening at the highest level in Kisumu County. When you talk about teenage pregnancy in Kisumu, Nyakach and Nyando are leading at 19 per cent. This is why as a county, we need to stop and think on how to deal with this menace,” she says. According to Beatrice Odongo, the Kisumu County CEC for Sports, Culture, Arts, Gender and Youth Affairs, cases of teenage pregnancies are mainly caused by a lack of basic needs such as sanitary towels which then makes these young girls targets of lies and empty promises by men, especially the boda boda riders who lure them in the name of providing for them. According to Steve Kathaka who works with the National Syndemic Diseases Control Council (NSDCC) in charge of Kisumu and Siaya County, Kisumu is among the leading counties on HIV/AIDs with around 53,000 men being HIV positive. “Kisumu is one of the counties that is having challenges in GBV and we are seeing a surge in teen pregnancies. Kisumu Central leads in the number of new infections among the young people, followed by Kisumu East and then Nyakach,” he says. Phyllis Chepkemboi, a representative of FIDA Kenya says GBV statistics from Nyakach and Kisumu County as a whole are scary as they indicate that young girls are the most targeted group by sex predators. “The numbers of children raising children is worrying, and as FIDA Kenya, we are looking at how best we can assist the young girls affected by this menace,” she notes. She says that despite GBV cases being a growing concern, some affected families fail to report the cases as they fear societal judgment."
People Daily,"Why yoga could improve your mental health, well-being",https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/why-yoga-could-improve-your-mental-health-well-being,"Monday 07th July, 2025 06:40 AM","When Boniface Musembi, a counselling psychologist and talk therapist, started practising yoga, he never imagined that it could transform his life in such a big way. His first session, he says, was confusing. But,  as he continued to practice, his love for yoga grew exponentially. “What initially drew me to yoga was the need for a consistent routine to calm the mind after intense therapy sessions. I began by exploring breathing exercises and gradually found myself integrating full yoga practices into my lifestyle. It became a personal form of therapy,” says Musembi. Musembi who works closely with the youth, parents and organisations by offering both in-person and virtual mental health support says yoga has had a grounding effect on his life and overall well-being. “To me, yoga is more than just physical movement. It’s a way of life; a practice that connects the body, mind, and breath,” he adds. He says that yoga has boosted his concentration, emotional balance, and sleep. Most importantly, it has taught me the art of slowing down and listening to my body and inner thoughts, something we often ignore in fast-paced environments. “As a therapist, this inward connection has allowed me to show up more fully for my clients,” Musembi adds. Every year, on June 21st, the World marks International Yoga Day, a day set aside to put emphasis on the transformative power of yoga on physical and mental well-being. Individuals like Musembi who have incorporated yoga into their lifestyle say they have found healing, stress relief, and a deeper connection with themselves through it. This year, the day was marked under the theme, “Yoga for One Earth, One Health”. The theme beautifully encapsulates the profound interconnectedness that yoga teaches us. It’s a reminder that our individual well-being is not isolated but intimately linked to the health of our planet and the communities we share. According to Radhika Dholakia, a Certified Yoga Instructor, yoga is a comprehensive discipline that originated in ancient India, encompassing physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of the individual. “The word “yoga” comes from the Sanskrit word “Yuj,” meaning “to join,” “to yoke,” or “to unite,” signifying the union of the body, mind and spirit. It’s a union of individual consciousness with universal consciousness,” says Radhika who has been practising yoga for more than twenty years. “While often recognised in the West for its physical postures (asanas), yoga is much more than just exercise. Its core elements include physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama) and meditation (dhyana),” she adds. According to the expert, regular yoga practice offers numerous benefits for both physical and mental well-being. Radhika opines: “Yoga is fundamentally about uniting the mind, body, and spirit. When we do it regularly, it consistently nurtures this connection, leading to a more integrated and harmonious sense of self. It also acts as a powerful tool for preventive medicine, promoting the body’s natural tendency toward health and self-healing.” Another great thing about yoga is that it enhances physical health. Consistent practice stretches muscles, increases the range of motion in joints and can help correct poor posture, hence reducing stiffness and pain. This translates to easier everyday movements and can help in healthy ageing. Dynamic yoga styles can elevate heart rate, improve circulation and help manage factors contributing to heart disease like high blood pressure and excess weight. On the other hand, yoga is highly effective in alleviating chronic pain, including lower back pain, arthritis, headaches, and carpal tunnel syndrome, by improving alignment, releasing tension, and strengthening supporting muscles. “Another aspect of yoga that cannot be ignored, especially in these current times when people are battling with mental health conditions is the profound mental and emotional benefits that come with practicing it. Yoga’s emphasis on mindfulness, deep breathing, and relaxation techniques activates the parasympathetic nervous system, significantly lowering stress hormones and promoting a sense of calm,” Radhika explains. “Consistent practice cultivates mindfulness, improving concentration, decision-making, and the ability to stay present and less distracted. This can lead to increased productivity and a more fulfilling experience of life,” she adds. Yoga encourages setting intentions, making you more mindful and deliberate in your actions and decisions throughout the day hence transforming your daily life. One of the most beautiful aspects of yoga is its inclusiveness. Generally, anyone can take part in yoga, regardless of age, fitness level, body type, or prior experience. The practice is highly adaptable, and there are countless styles and modifications to suit individual needs and abilities. “I believe yoga is gradually gaining recognition in Kenya, especially in urban areas and among wellness communities. However, there’s still a lot of misconception that yoga is only for a particular group of people or that it’s purely religious. My advice is: give it a chance. You don’t need to be flexible or spiritual, just be willing to breathe, move, and be present. Yoga has something for everyone. Personal and planetary wellness are deeply connected,” Musembi says. Individuals with specific conditions or needs such as pregnant women can take part in prenatal yoga while people with chronic pain or individuals with physical limitations or disabilities can do adaptive yoga. Those with mental health challenges, athletes or individuals recovering from injuries are also encouraged to do yoga. Radhika notes: “The uptake of yoga among Kenyans is on an upward trajectory. They are increasingly recognising the physical and mental health benefits of yoga. This awareness is driving adoption, with some individuals even taking up yoga on their doctors’ advice.” For example, several organisations including the Africa Yoga Project have played a crucial role in popularising yoga by training Kenyan instructors, creating job opportunities, and empowering youth, particularly in underprivileged areas. This has helped integrate yoga into local communities. Events like the Lamu Yoga Festival have gained international recognition, attracting both local and international participants, further solidifying Kenya’s position as a growing yoga hub in Africa. The celebration of International Day of Yoga at the UN headquarters in Nairobi, Indian High Commission, Art of Living Kenya has also helped to spread awareness about yoga, with calls for Kenyans to adopt it as an alternative or complementary healing method, which indicates a growing recognition and promotion of yoga at official levels. Radhika who volunteers with Art of Living Kenya under the banner of the International Association for Human Values (IAHV) Kenya says they offer different courses for yoga, including breathing and meditation. “My path has been enriched by my involvement as a Happiness Program teacher with the Art of Living and as a Sri Sri Yoga Level 1 teacher,” she says. According to experts, making yoga a lifestyle, rather than just an occasional exercise, offers a profound and holistic transformation that extends far beyond the physical mat. “Taking into consideration all the amazing benefits of yoga on our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health, I feel every individual should consider integrating yoga deeply into their daily life,” Radhika says. “In essence, making yoga a lifestyle is about investing in a practice that continually helps you remove obstacles to your best self. It’s not just about looking good or being flexible; it’s about feeling good, managing life’s challenges with grace, and living a more balanced, intentional, and joyful existence,” she says in conclusion."
People Daily,Working from home in Kenya stalls as opportunities dry up,https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/working-from-home-in-kenya-stalls-as-opportunities-dry-up,"Monday 07th July, 2025 04:20 AM","At the height of the pandemic, remote work was widely celebrated in Kenya as a bold leap into the future, a democratising force for employment that promised to unlock opportunities for women, young people, and anyone with access to a laptop and a reliable internet connection. For a moment, it seemed like the country’s labour market might leapfrog traditional barriers of geography and bureaucracy. That optimism has since given way to a more sobering reality. Between 2023 and the first half of 2025, job postings for remote roles on BrighterMonday Kenya fell dramatically, from 685 at the peak to just 95. While the country continues to position itself as a digital hub, the steep drop in remote work opportunities reveals deep-seated frictions within the economy: rising taxation on the creative sector, limited infrastructure, weak trust in self-managed workforces, and a labour market struggling to adapt to new ways of working. One of the least examined but most consequential forces behind this decline is taxation. In the past year, a series of new levies targeting digital content creators and freelance earners have made remote and informal online work less financially attractive. The Digital Marketplace Income Tax, expanded compliance thresholds, and the enforcement of the Digital Services Tax have introduced new frictions into what was once a fast-growing, low-barrier-to-entry segment of the economy. For young Kenyans using platforms like YouTube, TikTok, or Fiverr to earn income, the prospect of navigating tax obligations has created confusion and, in some cases, discouraged participation altogether. While the intent is to broaden the tax base and bring digital workers into the formal economy, the pace and structure of implementation have raised concerns. Many creators, already facing monetisation hurdles on global platforms, now face a double bind: local taxes eroding already slim margins and inconsistent enforcement undermining trust in the system. For employers, these tax pressures can disincentivise hiring contractors remotely, especially where withholding obligations and compliance penalties apply. But the problem runs deeper than taxes. According to BrighterMonday Kenya’s latest labour market trends report, the entire employment engine is misfiring. Despite over 1.3 million active job seeker profiles and more than a million applications on the platform each year, employers remain hesitant to hire, particularly for white-collar roles like sales, accounting, and administration. Each advertised position draws an average of 500 applicants, reflecting not only intense competition but also a persistent mismatch between what the job market demands and what applicants are trained to offer. Sarah Ndegwa, acting Managing Director of BrighterMonday Kenya, notes that while job listings have increased in sectors like healthcare, education, and financial services, the number of employers actively hiring remains lower than in 2023. The result is a distorted labour market: high job-seeking activity but low absorption. “The economy is not creating formal jobs quickly enough to absorb the roughly 800,000 new entrants into the labour market each year, most of whom are aged between 20 and 29,” she said during a presentation of the findings. Even in areas where demand is rising, such as software development, digital marketing, and project management, employers struggle to find suitable candidates. Tech roles are expanding, but they remain among the hardest to fill. This growing tech talent shortage is compounded by structural deficits in Kenya’s education and training systems. Cybersecurity, artificial intelligence integration, data analytics, and cloud computing rank among the most in-demand capabilities, yet are in critically short supply. The shift away from remote work is also a story about control and collaboration. While remote models initially allowed employers to sustain operations during lockdowns, many have since reverted to hybrid or fully in-office arrangements. Employers cite difficulties in tracking productivity, maintaining team cohesion, and managing deliverables.  The shift reflects not only managerial preferences but also constraints on the part of employees, including patchy internet, unreliable electricity, and the absence of dedicated workspaces at home. Despite Kenya’s rapid digital adoption, much of the supporting infrastructure remains uneven. This regression in remote work adoption raises larger questions about the inclusivity of Kenya’s post-pandemic work model. For many women, youth, and persons with disabilities, flexible work options were a lifeline. Their erosion could worsen existing inequalities in the labour market, especially when combined with the mounting tax burden on digital freelancers and content creators. Sectoral dynamics are also playing a role. The ICT and telecoms sectors, once at the heart of Kenya’s “Silicon Savannah” narrative, are showing signs of maturity and cost rationalisation. Hiring is slowing, and firms appear to be moving toward project-based or short-term contracts rather than permanent roles. This shift reflects capital expenditure caution in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty, rising financing costs, and government budget tightening. Other sectors, such as NGOs, education, and public administration, are seeing increased hiring, often tied to donor funding cycles or civil service reforms. But these gains are not enough to offset the structural gaps elsewhere in the economy. Kenya’s labour market remains fragmented, with different sectors operating on vastly different models of employment, compensation, and career progression. However, all is not bleak. Kenya retains important structural advantages that could support long-term transformation. With nearly half the population in the working-age bracket and average labour costs lower than in India or Eastern Europe, the country remains attractive for digital offshoring and business process outsourcing. Multinational companies continue to explore Nairobi as a potential regional hub for shared services, call centres, and back-office operations. Ndegwa reckons that to unlock this potential, passive market forces will not be enough. What is needed is a coordinated national response that addresses both supply and demand dynamics. On the supply side, this means investing in skills that match the needs of a modern digital economy, whether through vocational training, partnerships with private sector actors, or revamping university curricula."
People Daily,Why teachers placed their sunset days bet on real estate projects,https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/why-teachers-placed-their-sunset-days-bet-on-real-estate-projects,"Saturday 05th July, 2025 08:00 AM","Retirement often stirs feelings of uncertainty—financial instability, lifestyle shifts, and a loss of identity. In Kenya, a rising number of retired and soon-to-retire teachers are tackling these fears head-on by investing in real estate. From rental apartments and commercial spaces to community-driven developments, these educators are turning years of public service into a new chapter of financial independence and active engagement. One such example is George Onyango Mbeda, a former high school principal in West Pokot County. After retiring in 2022, Onyango opted out of his initial plan to build a set of kiosks. On the advice of an engineer friend, he instead constructed a five-storey commercial building in Kapenguria town. Now 40 per cent occupied, the Kapenguria Krall houses major tenants such as Kenya Power and the Kenya Revenue Authority. Built on a plot he bought in 2003 for Ksh750,000, the property is already appreciating in value. Onyango’s strategy is to target corporate tenants, ensuring stability and ease of management rather than dealing with multiple small-scale renters. Philip Otieno, the deputy principal at Tiengre Secondary School in Kisumu, has also embraced real estate even before his official retirement. He owns rental units in Migosi and is developing more in Kaloleni. His new project focuses on bedsitters and one-bedroom units designed for young professionals and small families. Situated within walking distance of Kisumu’s central business district, the location offers tenants accessibility without the burden of daily transport costs. Otieno’s journey was inspired by his father, also a teacher, and has been made possible by balancing his job with construction work during school breaks. In Meru County, Nkonge Mwiria, who retired in 2022, built 16 rental units in Igoji to serve students and young professionals from nearby universities. He says the investment has helped secure his financial stability and given him monthly returns that far surpass relying solely on his pension. Similar stories are emerging across Kenya. In towns like Bungoma, retired headteachers are pooling savings into cooperatives to build student hostels. Others in Naivasha and Nanyuki are exploring short-term rentals and Airbnb-style accommodations. Many retirees fund their projects through Sacco loans or lump sum benefits. Their long public service histories often make them ideal candidates for credit facilities. Phased construction is also common, allowing projects to grow sustainably over time. The devolved system of governance and improved infrastructure have further enabled this trend. Counties are supporting retiree-driven real estate initiatives by offering fast-tracked permits or tax incentives for developments that meet local planning needs. At its core, the move into property is about more than income. It offers a sense of purpose, continued engagement with the community, and a tangible legacy to pass on to the next generation. However, real estate is not a silver bullet and carries considerable risks, particularly for retirees navigating the industry for the first time. One major concern is financial overexposure. Most retirees use lump sum payments or loans to fund their developments, and if rental income doesn’t flow in quickly due to construction delays or low tenant uptake, they can face serious cash flow problems. This becomes more severe for those relying solely on their projects for income. Then there are the risks associated with construction itself. Poor workmanship, inflated costs, or rogue contractors can derail even the most carefully laid plans. Some retirees, lacking experience in the building sector, are vulnerable to fraud or mismanagement. Without adequate legal and technical knowledge, recovering from such setbacks can be both financially and emotionally draining. Even once the property is built, success isn’t guaranteed. Real estate markets in towns like Kisumu, Meru, or Kapenguria may fluctuate. If units are priced too high, lack necessary amenities, or simply don’t match local demand, occupancy can remain low. Prolonged vacancies strain retirees who must continue servicing loans and paying for upkeep. The ongoing demands of property management can also be overwhelming. From tenant disputes and repair issues to utility interruptions and rent collection, the day-to-day responsibilities can be exhausting—especially for older landlords. Without support from property managers or family members, these challenges can quickly erode the benefits of the investment. Another obstacle is market volatility. Political unrest, inflation, or changes in tax policy can dramatically affect both construction costs and tenant affordability. Many retirees expect steady returns, but real estate is a long game, and profitability may take years. Those looking for fast income might be disappointed if their projects stall or fail to reach full occupancy in the early stages. Moreover, some retirees become overambitious after initial success. They take on too many projects, expand faster than the market can handle, or borrow beyond their means. Without a firm grasp of market dynamics or financial limits, this can lead to insolvency and wipe out previous gains. Liquidity is also a concern. Real estate is not a readily cashable asset. In emergencies such as medical needs or family obligations, retirees may struggle to access funds quickly—particularly in soft markets where selling a property takes time. Despite these challenges, many are learning to mitigate risks through professional advice, phased development, and insurance. Some involve their families or trusted friends in operations to ensure smoother management. Cooperatives allow the pooling of resources and risk while diversifying across locations and property types, spreading exposure. What stands out in all these stories is the desire for dignity, agency, and financial resilience in retirement. With planning, discipline, and a realistic understanding of the market, they are building more than just structures; they are laying the foundations for a secure and purpose-driven life after the classroom."
People Daily,From shakshuka to Rolex: Why the egg remains king of the kitchen,https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/from-shakshuka-to-rolex-why-the-egg-remains-king-of-the-kitchen,"Saturday 05th July, 2025 06:40 AM","Let’s give it up for the egg, a humble, shell-bound miracle that’s delicious poached, fried, whipped, baked or scrambled. The egg is a beloved dish across the world. In Tanzania, it is a major player in the chips Maayai dish while in Kenya we love to take it hard-boiled or fried and in our chapatis in what we call a Rolex. Let’s start with poached eggs, hard to make, easy on the eye and not that complex in taste considering how much effort goes into making them. Contrast that with scrambled eggs. All you need is a pan and some milk and you can proceed to whip them to your preferred consistency. Heck, even a five-year-old can make them and still call it play. They can be wet, fluffy, cheesy, spicy, or tragically dry depending on how much you respect the pan. Add some chilli, swirl in cream, toss on herbs, or drown them in ketchup. They are delicious either way. Deviled eggs are quite delicious and not as hard to make as poached eggs. Just boil the egg, slice it then whip the yolk. You can keep it classic with mustard and mayo, or go rogue with avocado, bacon bits, or a dash of hot sauce. All this is to give the yolk some character while the whites remain untouched. Then there’s shakshuka, eggs in full-blown drama mode. They don’t just sit in a pan. They simmer in a saucy opera of tomatoes, garlic, onions, and chilli. Born in North Africa but adopted globally by brunch hipsters and flavour-chasers alike, shakshuka is the egg’s moment in the spotlight. Crack a few eggs into the bubbling sauce, watch them set, then scoop it all up with crusty bread and enjoy the work of your hands. Don’t sleep on sunny-side-up eggs. They’re deceptively simple. Cook them just right, and you get crispy whites and a runny centre made for toast-dipping bliss. Eggs aren’t just food. They are a global language of love. They show up at every table, across generations, across social strata. They can be your 5-minute fix or your Sunday slow ritual. You can eat them with your hands, with silverware, or straight out of a pan while standing in your kitchen like the emotionally complex adult you are. So here’s to the egg: cheap, cheerful, and endlessly versatile. One egg, infinite possibilities. This is your weekly reminder to enjoy them in all their glory."
People Daily,Why celebs’ marriages seem to be a ‘wantam’ thing,https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/why-celebs-marriages-seem-to-be-a-wantam-thing,"Saturday 05th July, 2025 05:20 AM","In a world where love stories often blossom under the spotlight, it seems celebrity relationships are breaking faster than Kenya’s political dalliance. Even before fans can say “couple goals”, the relationships are declared “dead”. From Mulamwah and his boo to global stars who we thought were inseparable, breakups have become a trend, public, painful, and puzzling. But behind the glitz and glamour lies a cocktail of pressure, exposure, and personal battles most of us never see. While social media captures their kisses and captions, it also watches their conflicts unfold. So, why exactly are these love stories not lasting? Here are some ten reasons why most celebrities are breaking up and calling it quits. When your relationship becomes everyone’s business, even the sweetest love can turn sour. Celebrities live under constant surveillance from blogs, gossip pages, fans, and even haters who never miss a detail. One small argument can spark a thousand headlines, and suddenly, strangers are giving marriage advice or predicting breakups. That kind of attention adds stress, mistrust, and emotional exhaustion that most relationships can’t survive. Unlike private couples who fight, heal, and move on quietly, celebrities are expected to stay perfect in public. If they unfollow each other for a second or don’t post for a week, rumours explode. The pressure to constantly prove they are “still together and happy” can feel like a full-time job. And when the spotlight shines too bright, love often fades in the heat. In the age of likes and followers, some celebrity relationships start more for the hype than the heart. A cute couple post here, a YouTube vlog there and suddenly they’re trending. But when the cameras go off and the filters fade, they realise they barely know each other beyond the content. What started as a strategy for visibility ends up exposing the lack of genuine connection. Clout may bring quick fame, but it can’t build emotional intimacy. Many celeb couples fall into the trap of dating for brand deals, public appearances, or fan approval rather than real chemistry. When the buzz dies down or one partner outshines the other, insecurity and resentment creep in. Without a solid foundation, the relationship crumbles because clout can’t hold what love didn’t build. Social media only shows the highlight reel, the matching outfits, cute vacations and filtered smiles. Many celebrity couples feel pressured to maintain this image of a perfect love story, even when things are falling apart behind the scenes. They keep posting happy moments not for each other, but for the fans who expect a fairytale. But pretending everything is fine doesn’t fix the cracks. In fact, it makes it harder to deal with real issues. Instead of healing in private, they perform in public until the weight of the act becomes too heavy. Eventually, the truth comes out, and the perfect picture shatters leading to a breakup Some fans forget that celebrities are human too, with feelings and boundaries. They overstep by digging too deep, making harsh comments, or choosing sides when a couple has a disagreement. A small misunderstanding becomes a trending topic, and suddenly thousands of people are weighing in, fueling tension that did not need to exist. Even worse, some fans turn toxic by sending DM’s, creating fake stories, or attacking one partner based on assumptions. This kind of pressure can damage trust and make couples feel like they are not just dating each other, but an entire audience. Love needs space to grow, not a crowd to perform for. In the spotlight, many celebrity couples feel the unspoken rule: always smile, always look in love. They keep posting cosy pictures and romantic captions, not because things are perfect, but because they fear the judgment that comes with being real. The pressure to appear happy becomes a mask that hides pain, arguments, and growing distance. But pretending for too long takes a toll. Behind closed doors, they may be drifting apart, but online they’re still #CoupleGoals. It’s exhausting trying to live up to a fantasy. When the gap between what’s shown and what’s felt gets too wide, the breakup often feels sudden to fans but in truth, it was slowly building behind the smiles. In celebrity relationships, money and fame can sometimes create tension. If one partner is earning much more, getting more attention, or rising faster in their career, it can lead to jealousy or feelings of being left behind. Instead of celebrating each other’s wins, it turns into a silent competition. Ego clashes also creep in when both partners are used to constantly being praised by the public. No one wants to feel smaller in the relationship, and when pride gets in the way, even small disagreements can explode. Fame looks shiny, but many celebrities go through silent struggles like stress, anxiety, or depression. Being in a relationship while dealing with these issues can feel heavy, and it gets harder to love someone when you’re still trying to take care of yourself. Sometimes, they don’t break up because they stopped loving each other but because they’re too tired inside. If both partners are going through their own problems, it’s hard to support each other. What fans see as a sudden split is often the result of a long, quiet struggle. Being famous comes with constant attention, and sometimes that opens doors to temptation. Celebrities are often surrounded by admirers, flirty DM’s and endless chances to cheat. Even in a committed relationship, the pressure and temptation can become too much and when trust is broken, it’s hard to fix. Infidelity is one of the biggest reasons many celeb couples don’t last. Sometimes, people simply grow in different directions. What worked at the beginning of a relationship may not work years later, especially as careers, priorities, and values change. Celebrities often start dating when they are young or just rising to fame, but as they evolve, they realise they no longer want the same things. It is not about hate but they have just outgrown each other. Some celebrity lives are packed with shows, shoots, tours, and endless travel. That often means spending weeks or even months apart. With such busy schedules, it’s hard to find quality time or maintain deep connection. Calls get missed, messages slow down, and emotional distance starts to grow. Over time, the long-distance strain becomes too much, and love quietly fades."

Think again. In the world of cocktails, eggs are the secret weapon behind some of the most luxurious, silky-smooth sips ever shaken. From the frothy head of a classic Whiskey Sour to the rich decadence of an eggnog, this humble ingredient brings texture, balance, and a touch of showmanship to the glass. Egg whites lend an airy foam and mellow out sharp acids, while whole eggs or yolks can add velvety body to richer, dessert-like drinks. These cocktails aren’t just old-school—they’re experiencing a modern-day renaissance as mixologists crack the code on bold, elegant flavour. Yes, there’s a bit of technique involved, but the payoff? Pure magic. If you have taken a pisco sour, whisky sour, gin fizz or eggnog, you have already tasted the eggcelent magic of eggs in cocktails. Shaken egg whites give a cocktail a light frothiness, and drinks with whole eggs in them have a creamy, rich consistency without the overkill of actual cream. And what better way to get your protein and buzz at the same time? Alcohol kills most bacteria that may be present in the raw egg, so you do not have to worry about salmonella. For best results, do a dry shake of the egg whites or whole egg without ice first, then add ice for the subsequent shake. But do not fret, we have rounded up four egg cocktail recipes that you can make at home to celebrate the reopening of bars countrywide. But before you use any eggs in your cocktail, do a simple fresh water test. Put the egg in a glass of water; if it sinks, it is fresh and good to go. But if it floats, abort the mission. Just get some more fresh eggs. Ingredients Method Ingredients Method Ingredients Method Ingredients Preparation"
People Daily,How to make your tiny kitchen seem bigger,https://peopledaily.digital/lifestyle/how-to-make-your-tiny-kitchen-seem-bigger,"Thursday 03rd July, 2025 06:20 AM","The kitchen isn’t just a place where onions are chopped and water boils; it’s the heartbeat of the home. It is where love simmers, tea brews, and life is stirred into every pot. But what if your kitchen is tiny? And this has a high possibility of happening due to the fact that most Kenyan landlords double up as architects and interior designers. So the next time you have a corridor for a kitchen and no budget to get a bigger one due to this thing called inflation, worry not. With a few tricks, you can make that tiny kitchen seem roomier, warm, welcoming, and wonderfully homely. With a little charm and creativity, your little hearth could be the heart of your home. Here are 10 deliciously doable tips to help you along. A little paint can go a long way. Choose warm, inviting shades like mustard yellow, blue, olive green, or burnt orange to make the space feel cosy rather than clinical. Even colourful mugs or a bold kettle can give your kitchen a lived-in glow. A framed food quote or a cheerful painting of avocados can instantly inject personality into your tiny kitchen. It makes your kitchen feel like a space you want to linger in, not just dash through. Tiny, cute mirrors, when well-placed, can give your kitchen an airy feel. They bounce light around and create the illusion of depth, instantly making the space feel larger. When placed strategically, they reflect windows, tiles, or open shelving, doubling the visual space without knocking down a single wall Plants bring life and colour into any space. A few herbs on the windowsill, a trailing plant or even some hanging ones will bring some vibrancy into your kitchen, giving the illusion of space. Your kitchen is your playground. Feel free to make a blackboard wall where you write lists of things that you should shop for. It could also double up as your little one’s playing ground or the place where you design the week’s menu. Open shelves create the illusion of roominess. They also give you a chance to show off your most beautiful or sentimental kitchen items. Think vintage mugs, heirloom bowls, or that oddly adorable teapot shaped like a cat. You can also use the shelves to store the things you use most to ease access to them. A small kitchen doesn’t mean it has to feel bare. A patterned runner or cushy kitchen mat can warm up cold tiles and give your feet something soft to land on during early morning tea missions. It can also be the pop of colour that enlivens your space. Remember to add sentimental things to your space, such as a child’s drawing on the fridge. Just don’t clutter it. Use tiles to trick the eye. You can use geometric tiles to create a backsplash. You can also tile vertically to create the illusion of height or horizontally to make the room seem wider. Ditch the harsh white fluorescent bulbs and swap them out for warm LED bulbs or even a cute lamp on the counter if space allows. A warmer glow softens the space and makes midnight fridge raids feel magical. Even in a tiny kitchen, a single stool tucked under the counter can turn your kitchen from a task zone into a conversation space. You can also make an island of your own and tuck in a few chairs to create space where the chef can even entertain company."
