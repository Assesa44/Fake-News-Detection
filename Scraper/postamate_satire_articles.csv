Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

DCI Agent Attached to Pastor Ng’ang’a Finally Gives his Life to Jesus,"March 10, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/03/dci-agent-pastor-nganga/,"There was an unusual event on Kiambu Road when a senior DCI agent attached to Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre in Nairobi finally gave his life to Jesus while tracking his The man whom we cannot name due to the nature of his work was busy spying on Pastor Ng’ang’a, as his job requires him, when he realized that the Jesus that Pastor Ng’ang’a was talking about is the one person that he desparately need in his life. Tired of pretending, the man responded to an altar call on Sasa TV, knelt on the cold DCI headquarters floor, and shouted one big Hallelujah. Other puzzled agents thought the man was just following an official script, but the man stood up and started testifying about how he has seen the light after years of living in the darkness. He even had nice words for his client Pastor Ng’ang’a. “I was lost, but now I am found. I want to thank the DCI Director for assigning me to Pastor Ng’ang’a. I was sure that we were going to jail him soon but it seems my sins got jailed first. I have no words to express my joy. I will continue to spy on Pastor Ng’ang’a because I know he has some criminal tendencies in him but that does not stop me from following the good teachings that he sometimes gives.” Interviewed, it is not hard to see why the DCI agent couldn’t survive Pastor Nganga. “I was assigned the known suspect Pastor Ng’ang’a and for six years I have been trailing him. I have been to his church, I watch all his live streams, and most evenings I am watching him move around the city.

Churches Conveniently Declare a Period of Prayer and Fasting in January,"January 14, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/01/churches-conveniently-declare-a-period-of-prayer-and-fasting-in-january/,"Churches all over Kenya have declared an extended period of prayer and fasting this month, a very convenient move because January economics has everyone skipping meals. From the big churches to small private churches, Christians were asked to consider either a 3-day, 7 day, or a 21 day of prayer and fasting just as it is the norm in the first month of the year. However, the timing seems just too convenient for most people. After spending the little money, they had in December and facing the usual 75 days of January, many people have found themselves with no option but to try some fasting in January. Others gained weight over the holidays, and January presents a great chance to get rid of the excess kgs. Fasting comes in handy. For this reasons, millions of Kenyans have heeded the clergy’s call to fast and people are skipping meals.

Sunday Service Cancelled after Bass Guitar Malfunction,"January 19, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/01/sunday-service-cancelled-after-bass-guitar-malfunction/,"A Sunday service was postponed indefinitely at a Pentecostal church in Nairobi after the only bass guitar in the church malfunctioned. The morning service had to be called off after an intern guitarist accidentally tripped on the revered equipment, breaking one string and seriously damaging the preamplifier that is used with the guitar. The incidence triggered panic and confusion as ushers scrambled the worshippers who had gathered and ushered them out of the church, promising them that the church management would get in touch in the course of the week. Even those who needed special prayers could not be attended to following the misfortune, and only the offering was collected at the gate as panicked worshippers ran out of the church. “We can’t have a service today,” said the Lead Apostle. “It will be extremely hard for the Holy Spirit to move in our midst without the bass guitar. We will have to do this next Sunday.” The youth pastor stated that the youth would not tolerate a church service without the bass guitar, further highlighting the importance of the equipment in worship. He however said that such occurrences were very rare, and it was a spiritual attack on the church that prides itself as tech savvy and hell nasty. The band members left shortly after the incident, resolving to do a 40-day prayer and fasting before the next service next week. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Speaking after it became clear that clear that Itumbi was getting more attention than everybody else in Central Kenya, Waiguru said that the attention would not amount to anything meaningful because the injuries are not enough to sustain long term attention. “I know he is getting all the publicity but it will soon end when he gets well. If Itumbi is to become Ruto’s running mate, he may need to get more life-threatening injuries. He needs a broken spine or a cracked skull.” Waiguru admitted that all of Ruto’s options on a running mate from Mt Kenya region were bad, something that could make Ruto take greater risks and appoint Itumbi as a running mate. “Itumbi stands a chance because he can rally people behind him. However, that is not going to happen. He needs more injuries if he is to get into that game. Trust me.” The Head of Hustler Nation Intelligence Bureau (HNIB) is recuperating at a maximum privacy prison after he was abducted and beaten, both physically and virtually.

Looming Cabinet Reshuffle Will See Ministry of Hustling Introduced,"January 6, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/01/looming-cabinet-reshuffle-will-see-ministry-of-hustling-introduced/,"According to some leaked information from Statehouse Kenya, a cabinet reshuffle is looming and one of the major changes expected will be the introduction of the Ministry of Hustling. The information which was confirmed by some State House insiders who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter stated that the reshuffle was meant to give a boost to the BBI initiative which ran into headwinds this week. In the reshuffle, a new position of the Minister of Hustling will be introduced in order to contain the influence of Deputy President William Ruto in Central Kenya. “The President is responding to the rebellion in his own backyard and he wants to deal with this by mainstreaming the hustler movement into the government.” Political analysts have argued that the position of the Cabinet Secretary could go to Gideon Moi, a man who just like William Ruto, is Kalenjin, knows poverty, and is currently rich. Last year,Gideon Moi opened up about his life in povertyand his story touched many Kenyans who grew up in poverty. It is not clear which departments will be under the new Ministry, but it is expected that the Ministry will help address the issues related to hustlers, gig economy, unemployment and BBI matters.

NHIF to Pay for Self-Medication,"December 18, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/12/nhif-self-medication/,"The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) will soon start paying for your favorite form of healthcare – self-medication. In a major win for the people, NHIF will compensate you for using traditional forms of medical care instead of rushing to the hospital anytime you have a common cold or a strange pain that you are unable to describe. NHIF has noted that self-medication is a popular form of healthcare and those who pay for NHIF and end up self-medicating should also benefit from the fund. “self-medication is a trusted form of health care in this country. The person who self-medicates is actually saving the country a lot of money. If you have a headache and you go to your nearest clinic, they will diagnose you with severe acute 7thstage head cancer, and NHIF will have to pay for your treatment in India. On the other hand, if you decide to boil some mwarobaine and drink that stuff for breakfast, you get well within 17 seconds. That is the power of self-medication.” The Ministry of Health also acknowledged the important role of self-medication, especially in the fight against Covid-19. “Our level 1 healthcare approach is self-medication. It has always worked. Aconcoction of ginger, lemon, garlic and honeyhas saved this country millions of shillings that would have been spent in PPEs of those patients ended up in Covid beds. We should appreciate such efforts by refunding their expenses from NHIF.” Besides self-medication, NHIF is considering paying for funerals because they make hospital stay shorter.

You can Lose Weight by Watching Workout Videos,"July 6, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/07/you-can-lose-weight-by-watching-workout-videos/,"Experts have observed that you can lose weight simply by watching workout videos without the need to exercise or have a gym subscription. In a perfect case of eating your pie and having it, you are now free to feast on any junk, provided that you regularly watch exercise videos. This eliminates the nagging practice of watching weight and counting calories which ends up making any good food unattractive. Through a study of 300 young adults who were struggling with obesity and weight loss, those who spent time watching exercise videos lost more weight than those who hit the gym. This finding is likely to set free millions of people around the world who have been slaves to the gym every day in order to keep up with their former body shape. The scientific explanation behind the results is still a mystery. However, it is likely that watching the workout video brings a similar torture to that experienced during the actual workout. “Watching someone lift 70 kg is like lifting 35 kg. This is why watching the video is as good as the actual workout.” The surprising thing is that watching work out videos works all the time, and even better when you are on a sofa and with some popcorn. The future of personal fitness is being disrupted by this new piece of truth! The study which was commissioned by a fast food restaurant showed that people who watch at least at least 25 minutes of workout videos every month tend to lose weight and become muscular. This was irrespective of what they ate. Gyms are set to lose big on this because they have always forced people to subscribe to tiresome activities and sweat for no reason. Nutritionists have also been served by the new findings since they will not have to lecture anybody yon what to eat. Any junk food consumed will effectively be neutralized by watching a few minutes of workout videos on YouTube. If you have a gym subscription, it is time you demanded for a refund and an apology and start watching workout videos. Earlier in the year, the value ofjogging was also debunked.

Entomologists now warn that it might be a few years before we see an insectalypse. “If we do not reverse the current trend, we will see a situation where cockroaches will be wiped off from the face of the kitchen. This will result in an imbalance in the ecosystem, leading to the overpopulation of harmful bacteria, a resurgence of rats, and the eventual death of the human species.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

ISIS Moves on to Other Targets After US Commits to Self-Destruction,"June 4, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/06/isis-moves-on-to-other-targets-after-us-commits-to-self-destruction/,"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) has indicated that it will stop targeting all American interests and instead focus on other viable targets effective today, following the United States’ commitment to self destruction. Speaking in a undisclosed location within Syria, the ISIS spokesperson said that the organization would no longer engage with the terrorist government of the United States as it had shown commitment to destroying itself from within. They said that the US stood a good chance of totally annihilating itself from the map if it sustained the pressure it was giving itself, thus no need for any action on their part. The change of strategy means that the US is now free to whatever it wishes in the race to total destruction, including using the nuclear weapons to clear protesters or hellfire missiles to aid delivery of tear gas to protesters. The move is a severe loss of motivation for ISIS, but they plan to find another suitable target that can draw as much hate and anger as the US, saying that the current targets were not as promising but they have to move on. Meanwhile, Trump warned that he ahs a big nuclear button which works, and he would not hesitate from using it if protesters forced his hands. He said that although his hands were small, he had figured out how to delegate pressing of the button and any junior intern at the White House.

Disquiet in CITAM as Calisto Repeatedly ends Sermon with only One Conclusion,"March 28, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/03/citam-calisto-sermon-disquiet/,"A storm is brewing atChrist is the Answer Ministriesafter an increasing number of members expressed disapproval on the way the Presiding Bishop Calisto Odede has been concluding his sermons. It is reported that the new Bishop has broken from the long held Christian tradition of having seven conclusions in a sermon. Instead,Calisto Odedehas stuck to a single conclusion per sermon, something that is dividing the church. Members are already talking in hushed tones and others have even gone public with their concerns. If not addressed, these might mean doom or one of Kenya’s largest churches. One card carrying member did not mince his words. “It is against the Christian doctrines to end a sermon with one conclusion. An average preacher must conclude at least three times, while a good one can do it even seven times. Why is Calisto doing a single conclusion? That is sacrilege!” Even members of other churches held the same views. “You know when a preacher says ‘In conclusion,’ you except them to speak for some minutes then say ‘finally’. This could go one for another ten minutes before they say ‘as I wind up’ or even ‘lastly’. What we are hearing from CITAM is not Christian at all. Calisto needs some form of reeducation.” An internal committee set up by the CITAM to review the performance of the Bishop did not find any wrong doing on his part, although his conclusions are not satisfactorily conclusive. This could be something that has been inherited from the Baptist Church. “He seems to have his homiletics figured out. His doctrine is sound, and his jokes are good or mildly funny. What is of concern to most members is the small matter on conclusion, which we are hoping will change.” A spot check with other churches showed that Bishops are known to make several concluding statements and members have gotten used to it. In fact, it is the normal thing and any deviation from the tradition has led to church splits or below average performance. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Country Likely to Experience Dry Conditions If It Does Not Rain Soon –  Meteorology Department Warns,"August 16, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/08/country-likely-to-experience-dry-conditions-if-it-does-not-rain-soon-meteorology-department-warns/,"The country is likely to suffer from drought if we do not receive rainfall soon the met department has warned. According to Deputy Director of Kenya Meteorological department (KMD), Bernard Chanzu the lack of rain was due to absence of clouds. He also clarified that the current chilly conditions being experienced were due to the long distance from the sun.“The story of the cold weather begins in the southern hemisphere, which is experiencing winter as it is far away from the sun at this time of the year. The southern hemisphere is the area of the Earth that is south of the Equator. That is why it also colder at night because the sun is not there.” He explained. He also predicted that the cold season will continue until we enter the warmer months. The meteorology department has also cautioned Kenyans to be prepared that the month of August is likely to be followed by September which will have 30 days. Responding to a question on weather forecasting, Mr Chanzu clarified that the meteorology department only predict events after they occur. “That is why we are so accurate, it’s all science.” He added.

Parents Claim that Internal Self-Governance is Just Wishful Thinking,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/06/parents-claim-that-internal-self-governance-is-just-wishful-thinking/,"On a day when Kenya is celebrating internal self-governance, also known as Madaraka, many people are questioning the whole idea of self governance and most parents now think it is a form of wishful thinking. Speaking to Postamate, most parents wondered where the notion that one can govern themselves without external influence came from, saying that those who attempt such nonsense have always ended up on the wrong side of the law, and in Africa, of the slippers. One mother of twins called it an absurd and impossible ideology. “The idea of self-governance is a farce. At best, it can only lead to self destruction. I spend all my day trying to keep toddlers alive and any single second I take my eyes off them I find them just seconds to disaster.” In another case, a parent told of how his teenage son is bent on doing only the wrong thing and he thinks that it is cool. “I have one 17 year old who thinks that the world revolves around him and considers himself a millionaire, yet he has never made a single coin in his life. How do I let such a person run their own life?” Even parents themselves are not fit enough to govern themselves. One man said that he is not allowed to leave the house and come back anytime he wishes, instead being forced to abandon every activity at sunset against his wishes and head home. His desire to stay in bed all day is also not allowed by circumstances. Maybe even countries need to rethink this entitled view. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Sunday Service Cancelled after Bass Guitar Malfunction,"January 19, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/01/sunday-service-cancelled-after-bass-guitar-malfunction/,"A Sunday service was postponed indefinitely at a Pentecostal church in Nairobi after the only bass guitar in the church malfunctioned. The morning service had to be called off after an intern guitarist accidentally tripped on the revered equipment, breaking one string and seriously damaging the preamplifier that is used with the guitar. The incidence triggered panic and confusion as ushers scrambled the worshippers who had gathered and ushered them out of the church, promising them that the church management would get in touch in the course of the week. Even those who needed special prayers could not be attended to following the misfortune, and only the offering was collected at the gate as panicked worshippers ran out of the church. “We can’t have a service today,” said the Lead Apostle. “It will be extremely hard for the Holy Spirit to move in our midst without the bass guitar. We will have to do this next Sunday.” The youth pastor stated that the youth would not tolerate a church service without the bass guitar, further highlighting the importance of the equipment in worship. He however said that such occurrences were very rare, and it was a spiritual attack on the church that prides itself as tech savvy and hell nasty. The band members left shortly after the incident, resolving to do a 40-day prayer and fasting before the next service next week. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Jet-Setting Cabinet Secretary Outpaces Kajiado County in Carbon Emissions!,No Date,https://postamate.com/2023/12/jet-setting-cabinet-secretary-outpaces-kajiado-county-in-carbon-emissions/,"In the bustling world of political Kenya, there’s a certain Cabinet Secretary who has become quite the globetrotter. This jet-setting CS, whose name we’ll keep under wraps for now, has been zipping across continents with such frequency that one might mistake his office for an airport lounge! Now, while this high-flying lifestyle might seem glamorous, there’s a less shiny side to it – the carbon footprint. You see, every time our CS friend takes off on another business adventure, his plane pumps out a hefty amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In fact, his travels have been so extensive that they’ve racked up more carbon emissions than the entire Kajiado County! Yes, you heard it right. One man’s travel itinerary is outpacing the carbon output of a whole county’s worth of people, livestock, and vehicles. It’s a classic case of “do as I say, not as I do”. On one hand, there’s Kajiado County, working hard to keep their emissions low, while on the other hand, our CS is single-handedly tipping the scales with his air miles. Perhaps it’s time for our CS to consider swapping his first-class seat for a virtual meeting every once in a while. After all, in this age of technology, who needs to fly halfway around the world for a meeting, just to say nothing from my end? So here’s to hoping that our high-flying executive might come back down to earth soon – at least in terms of his carbon emissions! Until then, Kajiado County can take solace in the fact that they’re doing their part for the environment, even if their efforts are being somewhat overshadowed by one man’s globe-trotting exploits.

Nurses in Kenya Ranked 3rd Most Cruel in the World,"October 8, 2022",https://postamate.com/2022/10/kenya-nurses-3rd-most-cruel/,"The World Health Organization’s health systems performance index has placed nurses in Kenya in the 3rdposition on the healthcare workers cruelty index. The Health System Performance and Public Health Steering Committee noted that nurses in Kenya mete out unimaginable cruelty on helpless patients, making healthcare institutions in Kenya an ‘active war zone’ and healthcare services a ‘hostage situation.’ The report highlighted the dark dealings that patients in Kenya go through, something that has been normalized and accepted as the normal state of healthcare in the country. “At times, patients in Kenya have opted to die than continue languishing in the hands of institutionalized terrorism in the name of healthcare. Nurses in Kenya respect neither the elderly nor the terminally ill. They fear neither God nor the devil.” The cruelty of nurses is also supported by dysfunctional public healthcare institutions and greedy private hospitals which solely exist to mint money out of patients. This leaves sick Kenyans with no hope in this life, except in self-medicating. While despicable things have happened in hands of Kenyan nurses, this is not the worst the world has seen. The top position went to Somalia, where nurses are known to randomly toss grenades in wards full of patients in order to close all active cases. The second place went to Myanmar, where nurses are known to kidnap patients from the hospital and force them to work on the nurses’ farm for months without pay. Relatives cannot question this because the moment you raise the issue, your patient will resurface in a body bag. Other atrocities committed by nurses that were recorded in the world include forcing patients undergoing chemotherapy to make them breakfast, demanding bribes before administering painkillers in surgical wards, and temporarily moving patients to the mortuary so that they can shoot TikTok videos in the wards. WHO now calls on the government to move with speed and correct this gangster approach to healthcare. “Nurses are supposed to help people who are going through the worst days of their lives. We cannot normalize a situation where the nurses actively participate in creating a patient’s worst day. This needs to change.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Meet the Man Behind NTV’s Killer Captions,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/08/meet-the-man-behind-ntvs-killer-captions/,"NTV is now more famous for its news captions than the actual news. All this is thanks to one junior technician who has turned the fortunes of the broadcasting giant. Francis Omondi holds only a certificate in IT from a college somewhere in the 7thfloor of a building along Tom Mboya street. His dream education path was to study and acquire a Master’s Degree in Diction and Soft Puns from Makerere University but as you know, we all have such dreams which we have to forget about and focus on putting food on the table. It is with this certificate and the usual connections that got him a job as an IT support Intern at Nation Center. This is the place where his unique talent has thrived, and funny enough, it came by accident. Contrary to popular thinking that Omondi spends all his time thinking of catchy phrases and killer one liners to use as captions, the guy’s main role is that of a technician who repairs computers and printers. He spends his time at the Nation Center running from one office to another helping workers plug in their ethernet cables and reminding officers that the reason their screen does not show anything is because it is not switched on. Coming up with captions is simply a side hustle of his job description. Usually, Omondi checks through news items during his tea or lunch break and during the rest of the day, good captions simply show up in his head . He carries a notebook and pen which he uses to jot now the ideas as they come because his volatile mind never retains any useless information for more than 2.6 seconds. “By the end of the day, I usually have many possible captions which NTV can use but only a few are necessary. Unfortunately, you will never see most of these because I am not even on Tweeter and I do not share them.” We spent a lunch break with Francis and we wanted to find out the motivation behind the killer captions. From his talk, it is clear that this is a man who was designed for word play. “I am serious about words because sometimes everything is simply about words, even words. You are probably familiar with the man who sent a short text message (then called telegram) and missed a delicate comma, resulting to loss of millions of shillings. In another case, it is a matter of life and death.” “Consider the following: Let’s eat grandma.VsLet’s eat, grandma. In the above case, you will notice that it is the comma that saves a life.” At some point during the interview, he almost went out of control with his words, telling us how farting in an elevator is wrong on so many levels, how alcohol is always a solution and how chemistry jokes get little reaction. Clearly, he is a man who puts his mouth where his money is. Generally, he is a good guy (because he also reads PostaMate). Has his newly found ‘usefulness’ gotten him a promotion? Certainly not. Francis is still repairing printers and asking users to ‘restart your computer first.’ But this is very understandable. The management at NTV is afraid that if he is given more money, he will lose his content and creativity. “You know the close relationship between poverty and creativity. We are afraid of losing him to money, so we would rather have him doing his work under the old condition. A day will come when he will hit the jackpot, but for now the status quo of poverty and puns will remain.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.
