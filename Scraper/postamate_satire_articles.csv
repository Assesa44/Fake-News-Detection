Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

DCI Agent Attached to Pastor Ng’ang’a Finally Gives his Life to Jesus,"March 10, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/03/dci-agent-pastor-nganga/,"There was an unusual event on Kiambu Road when a senior DCI agent attached to Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre in Nairobi finally gave his life to Jesus while tracking his The man whom we cannot name due to the nature of his work was busy spying on Pastor Ng’ang’a, as his job requires him, when he realized that the Jesus that Pastor Ng’ang’a was talking about is the one person that he desparately need in his life. Tired of pretending, the man responded to an altar call on Sasa TV, knelt on the cold DCI headquarters floor, and shouted one big Hallelujah. Other puzzled agents thought the man was just following an official script, but the man stood up and started testifying about how he has seen the light after years of living in the darkness. He even had nice words for his client Pastor Ng’ang’a. “I was lost, but now I am found. I want to thank the DCI Director for assigning me to Pastor Ng’ang’a. I was sure that we were going to jail him soon but it seems my sins got jailed first. I have no words to express my joy. I will continue to spy on Pastor Ng’ang’a because I know he has some criminal tendencies in him but that does not stop me from following the good teachings that he sometimes gives.” Interviewed, it is not hard to see why the DCI agent couldn’t survive Pastor Nganga. “I was assigned the known suspect Pastor Ng’ang’a and for six years I have been trailing him. I have been to his church, I watch all his live streams, and most evenings I am watching him move around the city.

Churches Conveniently Declare a Period of Prayer and Fasting in January,"January 14, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/01/churches-conveniently-declare-a-period-of-prayer-and-fasting-in-january/,"Churches all over Kenya have declared an extended period of prayer and fasting this month, a very convenient move because January economics has everyone skipping meals. From the big churches to small private churches, Christians were asked to consider either a 3-day, 7 day, or a 21 day of prayer and fasting just as it is the norm in the first month of the year. However, the timing seems just too convenient for most people. After spending the little money, they had in December and facing the usual 75 days of January, many people have found themselves with no option but to try some fasting in January. Others gained weight over the holidays, and January presents a great chance to get rid of the excess kgs. Fasting comes in handy. For this reasons, millions of Kenyans have heeded the clergy’s call to fast and people are skipping meals.

Sunday Service Cancelled after Bass Guitar Malfunction,"January 19, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/01/sunday-service-cancelled-after-bass-guitar-malfunction/,"A Sunday service was postponed indefinitely at a Pentecostal church in Nairobi after the only bass guitar in the church malfunctioned. The morning service had to be called off after an intern guitarist accidentally tripped on the revered equipment, breaking one string and seriously damaging the preamplifier that is used with the guitar. The incidence triggered panic and confusion as ushers scrambled the worshippers who had gathered and ushered them out of the church, promising them that the church management would get in touch in the course of the week. Even those who needed special prayers could not be attended to following the misfortune, and only the offering was collected at the gate as panicked worshippers ran out of the church. “We can’t have a service today,” said the Lead Apostle. “It will be extremely hard for the Holy Spirit to move in our midst without the bass guitar. We will have to do this next Sunday.” The youth pastor stated that the youth would not tolerate a church service without the bass guitar, further highlighting the importance of the equipment in worship. He however said that such occurrences were very rare, and it was a spiritual attack on the church that prides itself as tech savvy and hell nasty. The band members left shortly after the incident, resolving to do a 40-day prayer and fasting before the next service next week. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Speaking after it became clear that clear that Itumbi was getting more attention than everybody else in Central Kenya, Waiguru said that the attention would not amount to anything meaningful because the injuries are not enough to sustain long term attention. “I know he is getting all the publicity but it will soon end when he gets well. If Itumbi is to become Ruto’s running mate, he may need to get more life-threatening injuries. He needs a broken spine or a cracked skull.” Waiguru admitted that all of Ruto’s options on a running mate from Mt Kenya region were bad, something that could make Ruto take greater risks and appoint Itumbi as a running mate. “Itumbi stands a chance because he can rally people behind him. However, that is not going to happen. He needs more injuries if he is to get into that game.

Looming Cabinet Reshuffle Will See Ministry of Hustling Introduced,"January 6, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/01/looming-cabinet-reshuffle-will-see-ministry-of-hustling-introduced/,"According to some leaked information from Statehouse Kenya, a cabinet reshuffle is looming and one of the major changes expected will be the introduction of the Ministry of Hustling. The information which was confirmed by some State House insiders who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter stated that the reshuffle was meant to give a boost to the BBI initiative which ran into headwinds this week. In the reshuffle, a new position of the Minister of Hustling will be introduced in order to contain the influence of Deputy President William Ruto in Central Kenya. “The President is responding to the rebellion in his own backyard and he wants to deal with this by mainstreaming the hustler movement into the government.” Political analysts have argued that the position of the Cabinet Secretary could go to Gideon Moi, a man who just like William Ruto, is Kalenjin, knows poverty, and is currently rich. Last year,Gideon Moi opened up about his life in povertyand his story touched many Kenyans who grew up in poverty. It is not clear which departments will be under the new Ministry, but it is expected that the Ministry will help address the issues related to hustlers, gig economy, unemployment and BBI matters.

NHIF to Pay for Self-Medication,"December 18, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/12/nhif-self-medication/,"The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) will soon start paying for your favorite form of healthcare – self-medication. In a major win for the people, NHIF will compensate you for using traditional forms of medical care instead of rushing to the hospital anytime you have a common cold or a strange pain that you are unable to describe. NHIF has noted that self-medication is a popular form of healthcare and those who pay for NHIF and end up self-medicating should also benefit from the fund. “self-medication is a trusted form of health care in this country. The person who self-medicates is actually saving the country a lot of money. If you have a headache and you go to your nearest clinic, they will diagnose you with severe acute 7thstage head cancer, and NHIF will have to pay for your treatment in India. On the other hand, if you decide to boil some mwarobaine and drink that stuff for breakfast, you get well within 17 seconds. That is the power of self-medication.” The Ministry of Health also acknowledged the important role of self-medication, especially in the fight against Covid-19. “Our level 1 healthcare approach is self-medication. It has always worked. Aconcoction of ginger, lemon, garlic and honeyhas saved this country millions of shillings that would have been spent in PPEs of those patients ended up in Covid beds. We should appreciate such efforts by refunding their expenses from NHIF.” Besides self-medication, NHIF is considering paying for funerals because they make hospital stay shorter.

You can Lose Weight by Watching Workout Videos,"July 6, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/07/you-can-lose-weight-by-watching-workout-videos/,"Experts have observed that you can lose weight simply by watching workout videos without the need to exercise or have a gym subscription. In a perfect case of eating your pie and having it, you are now free to feast on any junk, provided that you regularly watch exercise videos. This eliminates the nagging practice of watching weight and counting calories which ends up making any good food unattractive. Through a study of 300 young adults who were struggling with obesity and weight loss, those who spent time watching exercise videos lost more weight than those who hit the gym. This finding is likely to set free millions of people around the world who have been slaves to the gym every day in order to keep up with their former body shape. The scientific explanation behind the results is still a mystery. However, it is likely that watching the workout video brings a similar torture to that experienced during the actual workout. “Watching someone lift 70 kg is like lifting 35 kg. This is why watching the video is as good as the actual workout.” The surprising thing is that watching work out videos works all the time, and even better when you are on a sofa and with some popcorn. The future of personal fitness is being disrupted by this new piece of truth! The study which was commissioned by a fast food restaurant showed that people who watch at least at least 25 minutes of workout videos every month tend to lose weight and become muscular. This was irrespective of what they ate. Gyms are set to lose big on this because they have always forced people to subscribe to tiresome activities and sweat for no reason. Nutritionists have also been served by the new findings since they will not have to lecture anybody yon what to eat. Any junk food consumed will effectively be neutralized by watching a few minutes of workout videos on YouTube. If you have a gym subscription, it is time you demanded for a refund and an apology and start watching workout videos. Earlier in the year, the value ofjogging was also debunked.

With food rationed and leftovers vanishing, cockroaches have now been forced to work for their living, a change that many are unable to adapt to. Entomologists now warn that it might be a few years before we see an insectalypse. “If we do not reverse the current trend, we will see a situation where cockroaches will be wiped off from the face of the kitchen. This will result in an imbalance in the ecosystem, leading to the overpopulation of harmful bacteria, a resurgence of rats, and the eventual death of the human species. The human race cannot stand another bubonic plague.” Even pesticide manufacturers have felt the pinch. “No one is buying Doom anymore. Cockroaches are now dying of natural causes at a very young age.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

ISIS Moves on to Other Targets After US Commits to Self-Destruction,"June 4, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/06/isis-moves-on-to-other-targets-after-us-commits-to-self-destruction/,"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) has indicated that it will stop targeting all American interests and instead focus on other viable targets effective today, following the United States’ commitment to self destruction. Speaking in a undisclosed location within Syria, the ISIS spokesperson said that the organization would no longer engage with the terrorist government of the United States as it had shown commitment to destroying itself from within. They said that the US stood a good chance of totally annihilating itself from the map if it sustained the pressure it was giving itself, thus no need for any action on their part. The change of strategy means that the US is now free to whatever it wishes in the race to total destruction, including using the nuclear weapons to clear protesters or hellfire missiles to aid delivery of tear gas to protesters. The move is a severe loss of motivation for ISIS, but they plan to find another suitable target that can draw as much hate and anger as the US, saying that the current targets were not as promising but they have to move on. Meanwhile, Trump warned that he ahs a big nuclear button which works, and he would not hesitate from using it if protesters forced his hands. He said that although his hands were small, he had figured out how to delegate pressing of the button and any junior intern at the White House.

Disquiet in CITAM as Calisto Repeatedly ends Sermon with only One Conclusion,"March 28, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/03/citam-calisto-sermon-disquiet/,"A storm is brewing atChrist is the Answer Ministriesafter an increasing number of members expressed disapproval on the way the Presiding Bishop Calisto Odede has been concluding his sermons. It is reported that the new Bishop has broken from the long held Christian tradition of having seven conclusions in a sermon. Instead,Calisto Odedehas stuck to a single conclusion per sermon, something that is dividing the church. Members are already talking in hushed tones and others have even gone public with their concerns. If not addressed, these might mean doom or one of Kenya’s largest churches. One card carrying member did not mince his words. “It is against the Christian doctrines to end a sermon with one conclusion. An average preacher must conclude at least three times, while a good one can do it even seven times. Why is Calisto doing a single conclusion? That is sacrilege!” Even members of other churches held the same views. “You know when a preacher says ‘In conclusion,’ you except them to speak for some minutes then say ‘finally’. This could go one for another ten minutes before they say ‘as I wind up’ or even ‘lastly’. What we are hearing from CITAM is not Christian at all. Calisto needs some form of reeducation.” An internal committee set up by the CITAM to review the performance of the Bishop did not find any wrong doing on his part, although his conclusions are not satisfactorily conclusive. This could be something that has been inherited from the Baptist Church. “He seems to have his homiletics figured out. His doctrine is sound, and his jokes are good or mildly funny. What is of concern to most members is the small matter on conclusion, which we are hoping will change.” A spot check with other churches showed that Bishops are known to make several concluding statements and members have gotten used to it. In fact, it is the normal thing and any deviation from the tradition has led to church splits or below average performance. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Country Likely to Experience Dry Conditions If It Does Not Rain Soon –  Meteorology Department Warns,"August 16, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/08/country-likely-to-experience-dry-conditions-if-it-does-not-rain-soon-meteorology-department-warns/,"The country is likely to suffer from drought if we do not receive rainfall soon the met department has warned. According to Deputy Director of Kenya Meteorological department (KMD), Bernard Chanzu the lack of rain was due to absence of clouds. He also clarified that the current chilly conditions being experienced were due to the long distance from the sun.“The story of the cold weather begins in the southern hemisphere, which is experiencing winter as it is far away from the sun at this time of the year. The southern hemisphere is the area of the Earth that is south of the Equator. That is why it also colder at night because the sun is not there.” He explained. He also predicted that the cold season will continue until we enter the warmer months. The meteorology department has also cautioned Kenyans to be prepared that the month of August is likely to be followed by September which will have 30 days. Responding to a question on weather forecasting, Mr Chanzu clarified that the meteorology department only predict events after they occur. “That is why we are so accurate, it’s all science.” He added.

Parents Claim that Internal Self-Governance is Just Wishful Thinking,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/06/parents-claim-that-internal-self-governance-is-just-wishful-thinking/,"On a day when Kenya is celebrating internal self-governance, also known as Madaraka, many people are questioning the whole idea of self governance and most parents now think it is a form of wishful thinking. Speaking to Postamate, most parents wondered where the notion that one can govern themselves without external influence came from, saying that those who attempt such nonsense have always ended up on the wrong side of the law, and in Africa, of the slippers. One mother of twins called it an absurd and impossible ideology. “The idea of self-governance is a farce. At best, it can only lead to self destruction. I spend all my day trying to keep toddlers alive and any single second I take my eyes off them I find them just seconds to disaster.” In another case, a parent told of how his teenage son is bent on doing only the wrong thing and he thinks that it is cool. “I have one 17 year old who thinks that the world revolves around him and considers himself a millionaire, yet he has never made a single coin in his life. How do I let such a person run their own life?” Even parents themselves are not fit enough to govern themselves. One man said that he is not allowed to leave the house and come back anytime he wishes, instead being forced to abandon every activity at sunset against his wishes and head home. His desire to stay in bed all day is also not allowed by circumstances. Maybe even countries need to rethink this entitled view. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Sunday Service Cancelled after Bass Guitar Malfunction,"January 19, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/01/sunday-service-cancelled-after-bass-guitar-malfunction/,"A Sunday service was postponed indefinitely at a Pentecostal church in Nairobi after the only bass guitar in the church malfunctioned. The morning service had to be called off after an intern guitarist accidentally tripped on the revered equipment, breaking one string and seriously damaging the preamplifier that is used with the guitar. The incidence triggered panic and confusion as ushers scrambled the worshippers who had gathered and ushered them out of the church, promising them that the church management would get in touch in the course of the week. Even those who needed special prayers could not be attended to following the misfortune, and only the offering was collected at the gate as panicked worshippers ran out of the church. “We can’t have a service today,” said the Lead Apostle. “It will be extremely hard for the Holy Spirit to move in our midst without the bass guitar. We will have to do this next Sunday.” The youth pastor stated that the youth would not tolerate a church service without the bass guitar, further highlighting the importance of the equipment in worship. He however said that such occurrences were very rare, and it was a spiritual attack on the church that prides itself as tech savvy and hell nasty. The band members left shortly after the incident, resolving to do a 40-day prayer and fasting before the next service next week. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Jet-Setting Cabinet Secretary Outpaces Kajiado County in Carbon Emissions!,No Date,https://postamate.com/2023/12/jet-setting-cabinet-secretary-outpaces-kajiado-county-in-carbon-emissions/,"In the bustling world of political Kenya, there’s a certain Cabinet Secretary who has become quite the globetrotter. This jet-setting CS, whose name we’ll keep under wraps for now, has been zipping across continents with such frequency that one might mistake his office for an airport lounge! Now, while this high-flying lifestyle might seem glamorous, there’s a less shiny side to it – the carbon footprint. You see, every time our CS friend takes off on another business adventure, his plane pumps out a hefty amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In fact, his travels have been so extensive that they’ve racked up more carbon emissions than the entire Kajiado County! Yes, you heard it right. One man’s travel itinerary is outpacing the carbon output of a whole county’s worth of people, livestock, and vehicles. It’s a classic case of “do as I say, not as I do”. On one hand, there’s Kajiado County, working hard to keep their emissions low, while on the other hand, our CS is single-handedly tipping the scales with his air miles. Perhaps it’s time for our CS to consider swapping his first-class seat for a virtual meeting every once in a while. After all, in this age of technology, who needs to fly halfway around the world for a meeting, just to say nothing from my end? So here’s to hoping that our high-flying executive might come back down to earth soon – at least in terms of his carbon emissions! Until then, Kajiado County can take solace in the fact that they’re doing their part for the environment, even if their efforts are being somewhat overshadowed by one man’s globe-trotting exploits.

Nurses in Kenya Ranked 3rd Most Cruel in the World,"October 8, 2022",https://postamate.com/2022/10/kenya-nurses-3rd-most-cruel/,"The World Health Organization’s health systems performance index has placed nurses in Kenya in the 3rdposition on the healthcare workers cruelty index. The Health System Performance and Public Health Steering Committee noted that nurses in Kenya mete out unimaginable cruelty on helpless patients, making healthcare institutions in Kenya an ‘active war zone’ and healthcare services a ‘hostage situation.’ The report highlighted the dark dealings that patients in Kenya go through, something that has been normalized and accepted as the normal state of healthcare in the country. “At times, patients in Kenya have opted to die than continue languishing in the hands of institutionalized terrorism in the name of healthcare. Nurses in Kenya respect neither the elderly nor the terminally ill. They fear neither God nor the devil.” The cruelty of nurses is also supported by dysfunctional public healthcare institutions and greedy private hospitals which solely exist to mint money out of patients. This leaves sick Kenyans with no hope in this life, except in self-medicating. While despicable things have happened in hands of Kenyan nurses, this is not the worst the world has seen. The top position went to Somalia, where nurses are known to randomly toss grenades in wards full of patients in order to close all active cases. The second place went to Myanmar, where nurses are known to kidnap patients from the hospital and force them to work on the nurses’ farm for months without pay. Relatives cannot question this because the moment you raise the issue, your patient will resurface in a body bag. Other atrocities committed by nurses that were recorded in the world include forcing patients undergoing chemotherapy to make them breakfast, demanding bribes before administering painkillers in surgical wards, and temporarily moving patients to the mortuary so that they can shoot TikTok videos in the wards. WHO now calls on the government to move with speed and correct this gangster approach to healthcare. “Nurses are supposed to help people who are going through the worst days of their lives. We cannot normalize a situation where the nurses actively participate in creating a patient’s worst day. This needs to change.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Meet the Man Behind NTV’s Killer Captions,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/08/meet-the-man-behind-ntvs-killer-captions/,"NTV is now more famous for its news captions than the actual news. All this is thanks to one junior technician who has turned the fortunes of the broadcasting giant. Francis Omondi holds only a certificate in IT from a college somewhere in the 7thfloor of a building along Tom Mboya street. His dream education path was to study and acquire a Master’s Degree in Diction and Soft Puns from Makerere University but as you know, we all have such dreams which we have to forget about and focus on putting food on the table. It is with this certificate and the usual connections that got him a job as an IT support Intern at Nation Center. This is the place where his unique talent has thrived, and funny enough, it came by accident. Contrary to popular thinking that Omondi spends all his time thinking of catchy phrases and killer one liners to use as captions, the guy’s main role is that of a technician who repairs computers and printers. He spends his time at the Nation Center running from one office to another helping workers plug in their ethernet cables and reminding officers that the reason their screen does not show anything is because it is not switched on. Coming up with captions is simply a side hustle of his job description. Usually, Omondi checks through news items during his tea or lunch break and during the rest of the day, good captions simply show up in his head . He carries a notebook and pen which he uses to jot now the ideas as they come because his volatile mind never retains any useless information for more than 2.6 seconds. “By the end of the day, I usually have many possible captions which NTV can use but only a few are necessary. Unfortunately, you will never see most of these because I am not even on Tweeter and I do not share them.” We spent a lunch break with Francis and we wanted to find out the motivation behind the killer captions. From his talk, it is clear that this is a man who was designed for word play. “I am serious about words because sometimes everything is simply about words, even words. You are probably familiar with the man who sent a short text message (then called telegram) and missed a delicate comma, resulting to loss of millions of shillings. In another case, it is a matter of life and death.” “Consider the following: Let’s eat grandma.VsLet’s eat, grandma. In the above case, you will notice that it is the comma that saves a life.” At some point during the interview, he almost went out of control with his words, telling us how farting in an elevator is wrong on so many levels, how alcohol is always a solution and how chemistry jokes get little reaction. Clearly, he is a man who puts his mouth where his money is. Generally, he is a good guy (because he also reads PostaMate). Has his newly found ‘usefulness’ gotten him a promotion? Certainly not. Francis is still repairing printers and asking users to ‘restart your computer first.’ But this is very understandable. The management at NTV is afraid that if he is given more money, he will lose his content and creativity. “You know the close relationship between poverty and creativity. We are afraid of losing him to money, so we would rather have him doing his work under the old condition.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it.

The painful observation was made by the father of the two Kianjokoma brothers who is still unable to speak due to the pain involved. “If the officers had shot dead an elephant or even a rhino right here in Mt Kenya forest, by now they would have been hanged for the crime they did. Unfortunately, they only killed two human beings, and will thus continue playing hide and seek with the courts, until everyone forgets and moves on.” The distraught father cited Willie Kimani’s case which is still dragging on more than five years later, with little or no hope of a conviction. He argued that the case for Kianjokoma brothers was slowly taking the same route and as soon as public interest fades, the case will be delayed indefinitely. Already, the accused have already started the cat and mouse game, demanding for the bodies to be exhumed, and changing lawyers in order to delay the case. If it was a poaching case, the officers would have been shot dead before they were arrested, and the cause of death would have been a wild animal attack.

Parents, teachers, students and the government were seen making last minutes efforts to get the education machine running once again. Teachers were looking for notes, parents were desperately seeking for loans to pay school fees, and students were on the last minute working on their assignments. But it is the government that was caught between a rock and a few more rocks. The government wanted students to socially distance so that they would minimize the spread of Covid-19. It also needed more classrooms to enable that to happen. It also needed headteachers not to send students home for school fees, although there was no money forthcoming from the government. There were little options and the best that the government could do was to work with what was available. Ridden with shame, the government sent children to study under the trees and admitted that it was impossible to build classrooms. Desks that had been ordered were nowhere to be found, and the only excuse the government had for all this mess was time. “I wish we had nine months to prepare. We could have built classrooms, bought desks, hired more teachers, and trained school staff on how to fight Covid-19.

6 Reasons why Comrades should be the ones Cleaning Universities,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/10/comrades-to-clean-universities/,"Universities spend millions of shillings every year paying for cleaning services, while at the same time sitting on a huge pile of free labor that can be used to do the work. Our research has shown that Universities would be better off if they saved themselves the money and used that free labor. This can even be made better by tying a student’s reputation with HELB, which means that the more they clean, the more HELB will be gracious to them. Our social scientists have come up with six convincing reasons why university students should made to clean the universities everyday, and we shall be presenting this to His Earthquakeness George Magoha soon. Here is the why: Save for the small minority of medical and civil engineering students, majority of comrades have nothing to do in campus. Days are long with just one lecture at 3 pm, and nights are even longer. Wouldn’t it be great if they used that free time to scrub the lecture halls, clean the mess and ensure that washrooms are not stinking. KenGen is exploring ways to convert excess energy of the comrades into electricity and connect them to the national grid. But before then, we need a way to safely dissipate this unused energy that is locked in comrades. Getting them to scrub off graffiti from walls would be a good use of this national resource. Although we have not yet told them that there will be no jobs when thy graduate, we need to prepare them for this reality. Since most of them will simply go into menial jobs, why don’t they start early enough? Making them do the cleaning will be the most important skill they will carry out of the universities. Unless if you went to a group of schools, cleaning must have been part of your life in high schools. Chances are high that you even cleaned the ablution block at some point of your 4 year study. This is the kind of experience that University management should tap into. Universities and poverty are always in the same WhatsApp groups. Lecturers wait for years to be paid, while buildings whose foundation stones were laid by the late Mzee Jono Kenyatta are still 3 feet tall. Yet, so much money is spent paying other people to clean lecture rooms as if that will prevent comrades from getting strong Ds. Save yourself the money, VCs. While most will not get jobs, there is a special category of people who are getting the worst deals from universities. These are the ones who study some carefully crafted courses with fancy sounding names but are not recognized by any employer in the world. The only job opportunity possible is to become a lecturer and teacher another set of failures. Can we do them this favor, please? Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Ukur Yatani Wins Jomo Kenyatta Literary Prize for Fiction for his work on Kenya’s 21/22 Budget,"July 30, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/07/ukur-yatani-fiction-award/,"Treasury CS Hon.

The University of York graduate was awarded for using spreadsheets and others tools to present the greatest work of fiction ever, using numbers. This culminated in the 2021/2022 national budget, which instead of falling in the category of fake news, ended up dominating headlines of respectable news media globally. Speaking during the award, a senior member of the Jomo Kenyatta royalty said that Ukur Yatani had proved to the world that ‘it can be done,’ and managed to shut down the negative voice of government critics. “There was no economic survey data, there was no foreseeable increase in revenue, and millions of Kenyans have sunk in debt – taking after their mother country. Yet, Ukur Yatani was able to paint a rosy picture of the state of the nation and even predict a more positive outcome. Kenyans are now smiling on their way to auctioneers, cheered on by an overly optimistic budget. This is great work of fiction.” The prestigious Jomo Kenyatta Literary Prize for Fiction is awarded to outstanding authors who are able to create compelling fictional narratives that can confuse even the Bretton Woods institutions. The award recognizes writers from all over Africa, especially those who can help governments cover their tracks usingcarefully rigged accounting principles(CRAP). The kind of fictional work that is recognized is typically where authors are able to create audited books of accounts from thin air, or just come up with figures that everybody can believe because budgets are an advanced work of fiction.

Kagwe, who heads Kenya’s health docket and has steered the country through the Covid-19 pandemic by sheer luck and guesswork received the award for his innovative policies and ability to retain a job when he doesn’t know exactly how health systems work. The award is another milestone for the Ministry of Health, which seeks to vaccinate 20 million Kenyans in 30 days, after managing to vaccinate 4.5 million Kenyans in 8 months. “The category 6 status recognizes Kagwe as a living joke. We seek to recognize people who just joke and exist as a joke.” Said the Chief Idiot of SoI. To be clear, no one knows what the award is about. Neither if a category 6 status is more desirable than category 5, or better than category 7. However, by observing previous awardees, category 6 status is such a great honor in the Society of Idiots. The last person to receive the award (posthumously) was a unpaidAl Shabaab intern who detonated a bomb to test if it was working. A notable mention is a man who wanted to poison his boss, but tasted the tea to check if the cyanide was enough. On his part, Mutahi Kagwe thanked SoI and said that he would continue to live up to the expectations of the revered society. Others who were present to witness the award were several Covid millionaires, relatives of the president who do business with Ministry of Health, and several cartels within NHIF and the wider health sector in Kenya.

Landlords in Nairobi now offering Three-month Trial Period as Tenant Shortage Bites,"February 20, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/02/landlords-in-nairobi-now-offering-three-month-trial-period-as-tenant-shortage-bites/,"It is a hard time for landlords in
Nairobi’s satellite towns as the supply of houses outstrips the demand for the
same, leaving landlords with empty buildings and loans to pay. So serious is the problem that some
landlords have resulted to some unconventional methods to lure people into
their premises, which include giving a three-month trial period or 30 day money
back guarantee if you do not like the house that you have picked. Even the old landlords who were making a
killing with inflated rents are now forced to lower the rents or offer coupons
to their tenants which can be used to offset rent amounts for a period of up to
one year, as landlords get desperate to recruit and retain tenants. Some have also resulted to offering additional services to their tenants, such as one-year free supply of salt and free membership to gym facilities near their residence, just in an effort to get tenants to stay. In some cases, landlords are closing two rooms in three bed-roomed houses and renting them out as one bedroom, then they keep trying to give you offers and discounts for you to purchase the key to the other rooms so that you can enjoy the benefits of the full house. The chairman of the landlords association said that being a landlord is no longer a passive business where ones visits every end month to receive money from their investment, but an active one where one needs to invest time marketing, getting creative and even up-selling to existing tenants. He said that landlords have to partner with the police to ensure security in their neighborhood, the local leaders to ensure the roads are maintained, utility companies to ensure that there is no unnecessary interruption of power and water, and also find ways as a community to keep their tenants happy in the neighborhood. In some places, the agents in charge of
maintaining houses are offering nyama choma Fridays just to make the tenants
stick around, others offering free laundry services, resident barbers and
salons, as well as school fees vouchers. In Kilimani, one only needs a positive CRB
record to get a house without paying a deposit, as it is assumed that the good
credit rating is an assurance that they will not default. A property consultant in Nairobi said that these
new measures by the landlords should be the new normal, saying that landlords
had the habit of doing business in a very 1943 style. “Landlords have not been
changing with time, and they have been acting like government inspectors or tax
collectors. It is the time they realized that they are in different world and
need to learn from other sectors.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel. We bring to you the best of satire.",PostaMate,satire
Uber to Start Charging Fare Depending on Passenger Weight,"February 24, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/02/uber-to-start-charging-fare-depending-on-passenger-weight/,"Uber has announced plans to start charging fare depending on the weight of the passenger, as one of the first steps for the overgrown startup that is trying to switch from philanthropy to profitability. In the new update that is rolling out globally this week,
passengers will be expected to state both their weight and their destination so
as to know the fare estimate. The weight will remain valid for three months
after which it will be subject to evaluation. Uber drivers will be expected to show up at your pick up point armed with an improved kitchen scale, just in case your weight is in question. Passengers are supposed to cooperate with the driver when taking weight, with the company promising total confidentiality. Uber says the move will result in more transparency and fairness
in its pricing policy. “4 passengers weighing 120 pounds each (55 kg) should
not pay more than 3 passengers weighing 180 pounds each (80 kg),” said the firm’s
communications office. “We shall be applying a different combination of factors
including the weight, distance and demand to come up with an friendly pricing
that makes business sense.” The move has been highly contested in places like South Korea
where matters to do with weight are kept a top secret, while highly obese
countries like the US term the move as a threat to national security. In Kenya, the move was highly welcomed by Uber Chap Chap drivers
who have always complained that their vehicles have a limited weight capacity,
and that every kg matters. While Uber claims that they are a transport company and that
is an industry where weight matters, human rights activists have condemned the
move saying that it amounts to ‘cargonization’ of human lives. They argue that
the move was an insult to the dignity of life and must be stopped. Uber says that the argument does not make sense and the
current model where every person pays the same amount is similar to asking restaurants
to charge the same amount of money for all the different types and quantities
of food. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel. We bring to you the best of satire.",PostaMate,satire
Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Kagwe Threatens to Forcefully Vaccinate all Kenyans by Drone Strike,"December 24, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/12/kagwe-threatens-to-forcefully-vaccinate-all-kenyans-by-drone-strike/,"Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has threatened to vaccinate all Kenyans through drone strikes if Kenyans do not take his vaccination threats seriously. Speaking after Kenyans failed to heed the government’s vaccine mandate, Kagwe said that it was time that drones armed with vaccine launchers were dispatched for mass vaccination in all parts of Kenya, starting with the densely populated areas. “We will be targeting the unvaccinated with the novel vaxfire technology using drones. Using special drones, we will identify all the unvaxed and forcefully fire the vaccine to them. This is a high precision technology that has been tested in wildlife and we can use it to achieve a 100% vaccination before any other country. This will be my legacy.” Kagwe further added that using blockchain and machine learning, the technology has the ability to identify anti-vaxxers and dedicate more resources to them. “Those who think they are smart should know that we are smarter. Our technology will deliver the vaccine whether you like it or not.” The drones fitted with vaxfire technology can fire vaccines at a rate of 600 injections per minute from a specially designed vial that can be reloaded remotely. With 47 drones, Kenya will be able to administer 1.6 million doses per hour and 3.3 million doses a day, assuming a normal civil servant working day of 2 hours. The move to vaccinate all Kenyans is meant to reduce the number of deaths caused by Covid-19. Increase in Covid related fatalities has threatened to affect Kenya’s loan repayment program as taxpayers of prime age end up not participating in national debt repayment.

Magoha Warns Against Giving KCPE and KCSE Candidates Special Food,"March 17, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/03/magoha-exams-special-food/,"Education CS Prof George Magoha has cautioned parents against giving exam candidates any special foods during the exam period, warning that many promising careers have been cut short by unstable stomachs in the exam rooms. Citing the dangerous tendency to bribe candidates to pass exams with food, Magoha said that many times the practice had resulted in the opposite, where candidates are unable to concentrate either due to excitement or stomach upsets. “I remember during my time I just ate the usual food and I made it to Starehe Boys Center, something more prestigious than Alliance. One student who was provided with Chapati and Beef stew never made it even to the local polytechnic. Special food is a scam.” While special diets may affect the physical wellbeing of students, there are other unintended consequences that may affect the actual performance of students. In 2019, it was reported that a student who had enjoyed baked beans in the morning made everyone fail the Chemistry practical in one school. While one experiment was supposed to result to a colorless and odorless gas, one student with a bloated stomach farted and everyone thought the experiment resulted in a gas with pungent odour.  There was mass failure at the school and several people who would have become doctors had their career cut short after failing the Chemistry paper. Magoha also reiterated that the 2021 KCSE results will be announced before the end of marking as a sign of efficiency in the Ministry of Education. “We are set to announce the results as soon as the first paper is done. We could do it earlier but that might undermine the credibility of the whole process.

BBI Wars: Firm awarded Tender to build the Bridges on the Spotlight,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/12/bbi-wars-firm-awarded-tender-to-build-the-bridges-on-the-spotlight/,"As the race for the Building Bridges Initiative intensifies, technocrats and stakeholders are becoming more worried than ever. This after it was identified that there is set to be a huge technical back set on how the project will be carried out. A document leaked exclusively to PostaMate shows how tenders to supply materials and build the bridges will be awarded to close and key allies of the Deep State. Only yesterday after a rather unsettling tweet from the IEBC, a section of leaders from Northern Kenya are asking: “There are only seasonal rivers in Nothern Kenya, and the people do not see why they need bridges which they consider will be a waste of money and public resources” From Mount Kenya Region, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s backyard, Contractors and business men are divided.  This is after rumors emerged that only a few of them will benefit from the tenders to build the record number of bridges, highest ever witnessed in the world. Opponents of the BBI have questioned the government’s decision to award the tenders of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas that will be used to weld metals that will be used to build the bridges. The company at the center of controversy is claimed to be associated with a confidante of one of the main hands in the handshake. In other regions like the Coastal Area of Mombasa and Kwale and Kilifi and the Lake Region of Kisumu , leaders are questioning the viability of digging and building bridges on the massive water bodies that are The Indian Ocean and Lake Victoria respectively.

Police Demand Justice for their Colleague whose Phone was Snatched on Duty,"July 7, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/07/police-officer-demand-justice-for-colleague/,"Police officers in Kenya have asked the government to bring to justice the thieves who snatched a mobile phone from a police officer while on duty in Nairobi. Speaking to the Media, several police officers said that the state of insecurity was on the rise and it was making it hard for them to do their work freely in Kenya. They asked the government to intervene and ensure a conducive working environment for the officers. “The streets are not safe for the police. We cannot be out in the street when there are people targeting us and our property. They keep snatching our phones and shooting us. What do you expect us to do?” The matter is further aggravated by the fact that the police are not allowed to form a union, hence there is no one to fight for them. Had there been one, the police would by now have gone on strike to demand for safer streets and a conducive working environment. A Police Strike would have numerous benefits for Kenyans, as it happened in Nigeria wherecrime rate fell drastically when police went on strike. Following the highly publicized case where a traffic police officer lost his phone to thieves on a motorbike, traffic police officers are now opting to leave their phones at home. Other have opted to buy feature phones while waiting for the situation to cool down. The officer was recorded on dash-cam directing traffic while on a call. A motorcyclist with two pillion passengers rides close to the officer and one of the passengers snatched the phone from the police officer before speeding off. The incident sent shivers down the spine of thousands of police officers who spend the day controlling traffic in Nairobi. Meanwhile, the Association of Muggers, Pickpockets and Thugs (AMPiT) in Nairobi has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to revise curfew hours from 10 pm to 11 pm, saying that the current 10 pm window was robbing the a prime time for business, especially in the CBD.

Seeking to make matters official on something that many people have known, the Secretariat said that lastborns were known to be the financial sinkholes for families and it is the time they were honored for the same. “Our data indicates that lastborns are the reason why many families are still struggling – never mind the same lastborns live like kings. They milk resources from every person and they never give. They are an economic blackhole.” The designation was welcomed by many people who seem to have held the same opinion for long. Some even went ahead to suggest that the position of lastborns should be abolished and no family should suffer the fate of having a lastborn in the current economic conditions. “I think it is time we honored them for who they are,” said an overly taxed first born. “They are designed to be annoying and always ready to invoke higher authority whenever things do not go their way.

Now, while this high-flying lifestyle might seem glamorous, there’s a less shiny side to it – the carbon footprint. You see, every time our CS friend takes off on another business adventure, his plane pumps out a hefty amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In fact, his travels have been so extensive that they’ve racked up more carbon emissions than the entire Kajiado County! Yes, you heard it right. One man’s travel itinerary is outpacing the carbon output of a whole county’s worth of people, livestock, and vehicles. It’s a classic case of “do as I say, not as I do”. On one hand, there’s Kajiado County, working hard to keep their emissions low, while on the other hand, our CS is single-handedly tipping the scales with his air miles.

The Doctor of Chemistry who is known for his obsession with alternative science and traditional medicine will spend several days at the Nairobi hospital where he will get an opportunity to explore the wonders of modern medicine, something he might be willing to replicate in Tanzania if God grants him a chance to get back to the country. The trip to Kenya which is a top-secret government affair has not been disclosed to Tanzanians owing to the sensitivity of the matter and government’s policy to keep the adventures of Magufuli away from the hardworking Tanzanians.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Mombasa Drug Dealer Takes Credit for all Jobs Created in the County this Year,"January 23, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/01/drug-dealer-creating-jobs/,"A Mombasa based drug Lord has lashed out at both the county and national governments for failing to create jobs, saying that he was the only one who was creating jobs in the drug ravaged county. Speaking at his open hideout, the drug baron said that no elected official had bothered to create any jobs and the situation was already getting out of hand in the island county of Mombasa. “The first month of the year is almost over and I have already created 27 jobs, compared to zero jobs that have been created by the government. It is like I am the government over here.” The drug dealer noted that he had signed up 27 new pick up boys aged between 6 and 21 who will ran his errands, and promised to hire even more because the churn rate is usually high. “We have many arrests, murders and the usual disciplinary process that leads to loss of employees. This means that we have to keep hiring and we can assure the county that we shall have more vacancies coming up.” The dealer also promised more opportunities once he expands to the neighboring Kwale County. This will happen once he sorts out a few turf issues that stand on the way. Besides the direct employment, there are more jobs that are created throughrehabilitation of drug addictsand numerous NGOs and government programs dealing with drug abuse.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Miguna Miguna Appointed as the Kenyan Ambassador to Wuhan City in China,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/02/miguna-miguna-appointed-as-the-kenyan-ambassador-to-the-wuhan-province-of-china/,"President Uhuru Kenya has appointed Canada based Kenya lawyer Miguna Miguna as the country’s ambassador to the Wuhan Province of China. In the surprise move that caught even the general himself by surprise, President Uhuru made the announcement through the 1 o’clock radio news, perhaps in honor of the late president Daniel arap Moi who had patented that method and used it extensively to hire and fire. Uhuru said that the appointment was part of Building Bridges Initiative which is committed to providing employment opportunities especially to Kenyans who seem to be struggling to make ends meet abroad. He said that the appointment was a clear evidence that BBI was working, and that the handshake brothers were concerned about the welfare of Kenyans from all walks of life. Miguna Miguna is now supposed to report to work within the next 24 hours and will be based at the epicenter of the Corona Virus outbreak, where he will be representing the Kenyan government especially on matters to do with trade negotiations and attending social functions. Among his first tasks, Miguna Miguna is expected to extensively tour the area and see what Kenyans can learn from China, especially in the healthcare industry. In keeping with Kenyan traditions, Miguna Miguna will not be allowed to wear a mask or anything that covers his face as that would be disrespectful to our founding fathers who fought the colonialists without masks. The general is not allowed to decline the appointment. At the time of reporting, some armed security personnel were heading to his premises to facilitate his relocation. Attempts to reach to him via his Twitter handle were unsuccessful sincehe has blocked himself on twitter. The government wished him success and a long life.

Archeological Evidence shows that Peter was holding an Axe when Jesus asked Zacchaeus to come down the Tree,"July 30, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/07/archeological-evidence-shows-that-peter-was-holding-an-axe-when-jesus-asked-zacchaeus-to-come-down-the-tree/,"In a groundbreaking discovery that has left theologians and historians scratching their heads, recent archeological evidence suggests that the Apostle Peter was holding an axe when Jesus famously asked Zacchaeus to come down from the sycamore tree. The discovery was made by a team of archeologists who were excavating what is believed to be the ancient city of Jericho. Among the artifacts unearthed was a remarkably well-preserved axe, complete with an inscription that reads, “Property of Peter, Fisherman and Apostle.” “We were stunned,” said Dr. Archeo Logist, the lead archeologist on the dig. “This find challenges everything we thought we knew about the early days of Christianity. Why was Peter carrying an axe? Was he planning to chop down the tree? The implications are mind-boggling.” Theologians have been quick to weigh in on the discovery. “This could explain a lot,” said Reverend Ima Believer. “Perhaps Peter was just being practical. Maybe he thought Zacchaeus would come down faster if he saw someone ready to chop the tree down. Or maybe Peter was just really into woodworking. Who knows?” Other people who are more into Bible interpretation and archeology argued that Peter carrying an axe was not something unexpected. “Consistent with his character, Peter had an axe with him and was just buying time to see if Zacchaeus needed some motivation to come down. He had even taken the first swing and was willing to spur the short tax collector to action.

KRA to Start Taxing all Dowry Payments,"November 10, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/11/kra-dowry-tax/,"The taxman in Kenya is on steroids and this time round, no coin will be left unturned. Starting in July, Kenya Revenue Authority will start taxing all dowry payments in an attempt to check the budget deficit that has been widened by the runaway corruption in Kenya. This is also in line with the government’s policy to become an upper Middle Income Country by 2030 through increased taxation. “We have realized that a lot of money is going into dowry and this is not declared by the recipients. Our estimates show that the dowry industry is worth 365 billion shillings and we are targeting a fixed tax of 15% on this. This is way much lower than the corporate tax of 30%.” The run on dowry is the latest attempt by the taxman in Kenya to get everyone to pay tax, arguing that young people in the 20s make a lot of money which ends up as dowry payment. The other amount is spent on weddings and plans are underway to tax this too. “By 2025, we want Kenyans to be paying 10% of their wedding expenses as tax!” The dowry tax has elicited mixed reactions with many people from Central Kenya, especially Kiambu, opposing the punitive tax. Aspiring Kiambu Senator Isaac Mwaura warned that the tax would unfairly punish daughters of Kiambu since parents will simply increase the dowry by a similar percentage to cater for the tax. “We are going to make it hard for poor men to marry in Kiambu where dowry is the highest, and you know well that poor men make the best husbands.” In Kakamega, former Senator Bonny Khalwale warned that the tax would be an exercise in futility since most people are not paying dowry in cash, but in cows and other animals. However, KRA is working on the logistics to get their share of the cows or any other physical goods. “If the dowry is 10 cows, it should be obvious that one cow belongs to KRA and it is the prerogative of the recipient to deliver the cow to our local offices.” Other monies that the taxman hopes to target in the near future include bribes, church offerings and money collected by beggars on the streets.

Covid-19 Less Deadly if You Do not Know that you have it,No Date,https://postamate.com/2021/03/covid-19-ignorance/,"Social Media virologists and communicable disease experts have finally converged to a conclusion that Covid-19 is less deadly if one does not know that they have it. The experts who have analyzed thousands of posts expressing the opinions of random social media users noted that those who have confirmed that they have Covid-19 have had a hard time recovering, while those who self-diagnosed with Covid-19 after the symptoms were over did just fine. The study now allows the social media users to continue wallowing in ignorance because that works better than being tested and confirming that you have the virus. In fact, most people have already assumed that they already had Covid-19 and survived, based on street statistics. The only thing that could change their mind is they land on a ventilator.

Covid-19 Vaccine Stolen in Advance Before landing at JKIA,No Date,https://postamate.com/2021/03/kenya-covid-vaccine/,"Even before the much awaited Covid-19 Vaccine could land in Kenya, Kenya had already happened to the vaccine. The more than 1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines started disappearing even before landing in Kenya, a sign that Kenya was still operating at ‘normal operating conditions’ and that our shared values of corruption, pilferage, outright theft and national greed have not been compromised. Despite the theft, the remaining doses will be expected to cater for a large number of elites and political war lords from the wider Eastern African region before we can start vaccinating the frontline healthcare workers. “Out of the expected 1.02 million doses of vaccine, we expect half to make it to the official distribution channels, of which some of that will be used to cater for political war lords from around the region because Kenya is keen on fostering regional peace and stability. The rest will go to our healthcare workers who have shown a high level of commitment to fighting the disease even without PPEs.” It is feared that vaccine will take the same route that aGerman consignment of 6 million maskstook in Nairobi.

The 12-day period which starts on the day just before the election is a rite that all Ugandans go through every five years, with the party getting bigger and better each period. This time round, Museveni’s government has promised that it won’t be boring, and there will be minimal casualties. “Every time we go to polls, we have this 12-day period where we work on restoring submission to the real government of Uganda, especially those in the capital. It is a tradition that we would want to keep and we urge the International community not to interfere.” Everything is set for the 12 days. The main opposition party led by Bobi Wine has drawn enough popularity to win the election, making the 12 days of violence more necessary because they should not win. The Electoral Commission of Uganda already announced that they already know the winner and are just waiting to make the big announcement, while International bodies such as the African Union have already started congratulating Museveni. With this background, police and the military have been testing their weapons in anticipation of the party that will last for the 12 days. Eventually, whoever wins is the one who has the most force and is considered the election winner. On one hand there is an incumbent president who is also a military leader, while on the other hand there is a musician who best knows how to handle a microphone. The results will be obvious.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too. It’s simple logic Analysts say Kagame’s gambit is peak absurdity, even for a conflict already drowning in it. “It’s Schrödinger’s army,” quipped geopolitical satirist Dr. Chuckles Mwamba. “The troops are both there and not there until the UN opens the box—and they’re too scared to peek.” Sources close to Kagame hint he’s already drafting a follow-up: demanding the DRC apologize for “imagining” his troops, plus a $50 billion mineral reparations package “for emotional distress.” As eastern DRC burns and the international community perfects its collective shrug, Kagame’s offer hangs in the air like a bad punchline. Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat? One thing’s clear: in this game of geopolitical charades, the only winners are the ones selling popcorn—and maybe the guy with the mineral cart.

Paula White Vows to Eradicate all Small and Medium Sized Demons from the US,"February 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/paula-white-vows-to-eradicate-all-small-and-medium-sized-demons-from-the-us/,"Newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula Michelle White-Cain, commenced her duties as America’s foremost exorcist by declaring an all-out war on small and medium-sized demons (SMDs). Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss. Some of these larger entities may require more drastic measures – a few hellfire missiles and a substantial funding cut should do the trick.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

BREAKING: Moi’s Grave Found Empty,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/02/breaking-mois-grave-found-empty/,"Shock engulfed the late President Daniel Moi’s home in Kabarak when his grave was found empty early on Saturday morning, barely three days after his burial. In the early morning incidence, Moi’s grandchildren had gone to the burial site to add more flowers when it suddenly dawned on them that the soldiers who had been guarding the site were missing, and the large plaque that the military had used to cover the grave was missing. The grandchildren alerted Gideon Moi who went ahead to the grave and indeed confirmed that Moi was no longer in the grave, although the grave was intact and the suit he had worn during the burial was neatly folded and lay inside the casket. It was a moment of confusion as no one seemed to know what had happened, and Moi had not talked of any plans to resurrect after three days. Others feared that his political enemies had stolen the body in order to claim that Moi had risen and was planning to establish an everlasting kingdom in Kenya, something Moi had always denied when he was alive. By the time of going to the press, the dream was still going on. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

Chaos as Children Vote to Impeach and Remove Dad as the Head of The Family,"February 7, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/02/chaos-as-children-vote-to-impeach-and-remove-dad-as-the-head-of-the-family/,"It was total chaos and anarchy after all the three children in a family voted to impeach their father and declared a democratic led family where everyone has an equal say. It all started the previous day when the children walked out on the father as he was giving the state of the family address, with one of them tearing apart the list of chores that had been assigned to each child and all of them promising to meet the next day for appropriate action. The impeachment followed a general dissatisfaction with how the family matters were being run by the parents, including a series of unfulfilled promises. The most cited ones included the poor state of toys, stagnation of random gifts that the father brings, causing family embarrassment by driving an old car and improving standards of daddy jokes. The children also cited absenteeism from home for the major part of the waking day, with the father giving an excuse that he was at work. There were also allegations that the father had called one of the class teachers and discussed some disciplinary matters without clearance from the affected child, something that had raised tensions within the family. In the impeachment that  was supported by three votes from the children, with only one person who crossed the family line to vote for the dad – the mother, the children declared their victory in the parexit vote and noted that it was the first step towards making the family great again. The children have now taken over the running of the family and appointed one of them to be the head. They have also demanded for access to all the family bank accounts and given a seven-day ultimatum for the father to become a stay home dad, else they will take matters into their own hands. They also said that the father will henceforth require level three clearance from the family before he can be allowed to go out and play golf. The father was not able to give his side of the story as at the time of going to the press as he was busy at work and was not aware of what was happening at home. More updates to follow.

Reprieve for Churches as Zoom Introduces Online Offering and Tithing Services,"May 11, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/05/reprieve-for-churches-as-zoom-introduces-online-offering-and-tithing-services/,"Churches all over the world are now operating like churches in China; underground. This is not a big deal because a religion that claims to worship an omnipresent God should not be worried by limitations of space. However, the missing function has been the money part. With Zoom, Meet, Jitsi and Webex helping churches to meet remotely, pastors have appeared a little frustrated by the lack of a way to get offering from their online members. In physical church meetings, asking for offering is easy because an usher can stare at you until you plunge your hands into some great depths of your wallet but in online meetings, this is never possible. Luckily, Zoom is coming to the rescue. The new features announced will allow meeting hosts to declare meetings as religious and add an option for offerings to be given by the attendants online. It includes several payments methods in all parts of the world as well as an option to set the minimum amount of money to be given. As if that is not good enough, Zoom will allow the host to know who has given money and who has not, a feature supposed to help the host ‘plan effectively’ for the next meeting. Churches have welcomed this move and termed it as a ‘game changer’ in these ‘strange times.’ Even churches that had sworn not to use any technology because it is the Anti-Christ now seem very comfortable with the idea of using Zoom. The new feature is expected to grow the market for Zoom in the global South by more than 900%, with Muslims, Hindus, Christians and Buddhists expected to use the service.

Kenya Power to Venture into Candle Manufacturing,"July 14, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/07/kenya-power-to-venture-into-candle-manufacturing/,"Kenya Power has announced plans to diversify its portfolio and venture into candle manufacturing in a bid to reverse its declining fortune. Announcing the new venture, Kenya Power CEO Bernard Ngugi said that the candle venture falls in the company’s grand vision of eliminating darkness in Kenya. “We are pleased to take our war on darkness to a new level with this new innovative product.” The new plan seems to have been motivated by KenGen’s announcement last month that it will venture into manufacturingdetergents. This was interpreted as an effort by KenGen to cash in from the other popular competitor in water consumption; laundry. Critics argue that the motivation to venture into candle business could have been informed by the increasing competition that candles are offering Kenya Power. “With frequent blackouts, Kenyans are forced to depend on candles and what Kenya Power is trying to achieve is to eat from both ends. As long as it is dark, they want to make money from you. It is easier to sell candles than to ensure there is power all the time.” What would candles from Kenya Power look like? We asked a number of people and they could not agree on the design or appearance. However, one thing that they all agreed is that the candles will not work most of the time.

In the report released last week to assess the effect of lack of a Governor in Nairobi, most residents said that they were enjoying a quieter Nairobi and less toxic politics, with government service delivery appearing to be doing better than usual. The report also added that Nairobians would want to experiment and see how it would work without MCAs. They plan to impeach all of them to see how it goes.

WTO HR Advises Amina Mohamed to Seek Mentorship from Polycarp Igathe,"October 9, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/10/wto-hr-advises-amina-mohamed-to-seek-mentorship-from-polycarp-igathe/,"It is always bad news to receive negative feedback from the HR office, especially when your life depended on the job that you had applied. However, this is better than the 99.982% of the cases where the HR simply ghosts you and you are not even sure whether they concluded the interviews. This is the position that Amina Mohamed, Kenya’s Sports CS, found herself in after desperately trying to clinch a job with the World Trade Organization. While she did not get the job, the HR at WTO was good enough to give her some very useful feedback while wishing her all the best in her feature endeavors. The letter from the HR was very short and has some specific actionable points. “We regret that while you are highly qualified and capable of leading WTO, the management decided not to give you the job. We therefore recommend you to Polycarp Igathe who can advise you on how to get such jobs.” Why Polycarp Igathe? Because Polycarp Igathe is the opposite of Amina Mohamed, especially when it comes to securing to jobs. For most of us who have the memory of a fruitfully (but that doesn’t matter because Google happened), Polycarp Igathe is the former Vivo Energy Executive who resigned to become the Deputy Governor in Nairobi, then resigned to join Equity Bank, then resigned again to rejoin Vivo Energy, before resigning to rejoin Equity Bank again. Whenever Igathe resigns from a job, top executives cringe because their positions are at stake. Igathe chooses the job that he wants. On the contrary, Amina Mohammed is the person who was fronted by the Kibaki Administration to WTO but failed, fronted by Uhuru Kenya to take the AU Commission job but failed, preferred by the United Kingdom to take over the Commonwealth top job, and recently, fronted by Kenya to take the top job again at the WTO. In all these job applications, Amina has been very consistent. She is a professional runners up. While the loss was a new low for Amina, at least she knows what to do.

Smoking Can Help you keep Warm in this Weather – BAT,"May 15, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/05/smoking-keeps-warm/,"A study commissioned by British American Tobacco has established that smoking is an effective way to keep warm during periods of extended cold weather that are being experienced at the moment. The new science shows that people who smoke are usually warmer than those who do not smoke, a discovery that can help people who are struggling to keep warm all over the earth. “This is science. Smoking is basically an improved version of breathing, where the air passes through a fire wall that is literally burning. The speed of smoking can help regulate the temperature of the air; hence the smoker is in control of how much heat is transferred to the body.” Although smoking causes cancer, the scientists are exploring whether smoking can help one live longer, in a similar manner that smoked fish last longer. If confirmed to be true, smoking will be recommended for anyone who want to live a long, warm and smoking life. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Uhuru Transfers DP’s Office to the Ministry of Agriculture,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/06/uhuru-transfers-dps-office-to-the-ministry-of-agriculture/,"In an effort to streamline government operations, President Uhuru Kenyatta has signed an Executive Order that places the office of the Deputy President under the Ministry of Agriculture. In the Executive Order number 8194 of 2020, the president said that he was cognizant of the immense role that Agriculture plays in the economy of Kenya, and thus a need to build more robust structures around the industry. In the new reorganization, the Deputy President William Ruto will directly report to the Ministry of Agriculture and will have sweeping powers to oversee an Agrarian Revolution that is expected to transform the country. This is in line with the Big Four Agenda which seeks to make Kenya a Middle Income economy through subsistence agriculture. The president said that he had faith in Dr William Ruto to deliver this country through Agriculture, citing William’s extensive experience in chicken farming and his education. “William Ruto holds a PhD in something to do with plants, and this is an opportunity to use this to move this country forward towards Vision 2030.” Ruto is now expected to lead the government efforts to eradicate desertification, manage locusts and prevent destructive floods. No single MP has commented on the decision. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel. We bring to you the best of satire.",PostaMate,satire
"Whatsapp Status Obsession: Kenyans Wasted a Week in 2023, Study Finds","December 18, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/12/whatsapp-status-obsession-kenyans-wasted-a-week-in-2023-study-finds/,"An average Kenyan spent 7.2 days aimlessly binging on WhatsApp status in 2023, data from the think tank independent Ridgeviews Analytica confirms. In a study that was conducted from January to November 2023, Kenyans again topped the world in social media engagement with TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouYube, Twitter and Facebook cumulatively taking one calendar month of their time. “It is like Kenyans lost two months on Social Media,” said the chief researcher and analyst. “The year is not over yet but the best a Kenyan can hope for is living for 10 months and spending the 11thand 12thmonths on social media. What a waste!” According to the report, an average Kenyan spent 11 days on TikTok, 8 days on Instagram, 7.2 days on WhatsApp status, and another 2 days on WhatsApp messages. Twitter took 5 days and Facebook 3 days. The elephant in the room was YouTube, which took 18 days, although most of those days can be accounted for by dogs, cats, and babies. What were Kenyans doing or watching on social media? On average, most cannot pinpoint exactly what they were doing online. Birthday wishes, vacation photos, cryptic song lyrics, keeping up with the Mwangis, the highs, the lows, the memes, and the spoilers. No one knows exactly what it was about. Football also cost Kenyans an average 2 days with political discussions occupying another 8 days, especially in rural areas. A notable trend was the increase in time spent commuting, as drivers drove more slowly to save fuel due to the high cost of the commodity. Tough economic conditions also forced more Kenyans to spend time alone, as many Kenyans do not know how to spend time with other people without using money. This saw a rise in the combined amount of time spent watching Netflix, DJ Afro movies, listening to discussion forums on local radio stations.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it.

Crime Rate in Lagos Falls Drastically after Police go on Strike,"July 17, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/07/crime-rate-falls-in-lagos-after-police-go-on-strike/,"Lagos city of Nigeria has seen a sharp decline in crime rate after law enforcement officers went on strike, raising questions on the role of police in causing crime. For two weeks now, cases of muggings, robbery with violence, break-ins and the regular kidnappings have dropped to near zero. Even the aggressive drivers who are common in Lagos seemed to have suddenly acquired a sense of common sense. The bizarre incidence has left the country puzzled. “Why would a police strike lead to a drop-in crime rate? We know that there is a relationship between police and crime, but what exactly is the relationship? Is it directly proportional?” Several theories have come to explain why crime is falling. Some people argue that citizens have become better at defending themselves since the police are not there to do the babysitting. This could be the reason why criminals are scared to venture out because they know that their targets are ready for them. Others have argued that the policemen might have been the source of all crime and therefore the fact that they are not at work means there is no one to do the crime. A similar theory suggests that police are the ones who license criminals. With the police on strike, criminals do not have a license to operate and thus their operations have been grounded. While most people are thinking that it is time to plan a future without policemen, some keen observers have urged for caution before taking any drastic measures. The data that that shows that crime rate has fallen was obtained from the Occurrence Books across Lagos State Police Command, which have zero entries since the police are on strike.

Ngong Hills Highly Unlikely to Erupt This Year,"May 25, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/05/ngong-hills-eruption/,"The Government of Kenya has assured residents of Nairobi and Kajiado Counties that the Ngong Hills are unlikely to erupt this year. Unveiling a taskforce meant to study the possibility of a Ngong Hill eruption this year, Mining PS said that preliminary observations had shown that Ngong Hills are not likely to spew magma on unsuspecting Nairobians. He however said that the taskforce would study the underlying rock structures and give a conclusive report. The Hills have always been dormant since they were formed thousands of years ago. Following the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, experts who only sit in offices but have never been to the ground feared that social media pressure could force Ngong Hills to erupt. The possibility of erupting had raised fears among many people who have bought land around Ngong, fearing that they might lose their investments. This forced the government to intervene and do the study in order to settle down the fears. Investors said that the rumors had caused a steep decline in property prices around Ngong. An eruption would also interfere with the giant fans that are strategically installed on the hill to help cool down Nairobi and solve the problem of climate change.

Man on the 47th Round of Interview at One Acre Fund Still Hopeful,"January 8, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/01/man-on-the-47th-round-of-interview-at-one-acre-fund-still-hopeful/,"It has been a tough three months for a local man. Armed with papers, experience, exposure, and connections, the quest for the perfect job has been going on. We caught up with him while preparing for the 47thround of interview at One Acre Fund, where he was hopeful that he would definitely land his dream job. For the past twelve weeks, the man’s only economic activity has been interviewing with One Acre Fund, going through several stages of interview for this one job. It has been hard, but then, this is One Acre Fund we are talking about. If successful, the reward of a full time placement in the magical location of Kakamega, the health insurance, the paid leave, the company branded t-shirts, local and international travels, continuous personal development and hefty allowances will rain. He must keep his focus on One Acre Fund. “It has been 47 working days of interview and I am still hopeful that I will get that magical appointment letter. I have met the CEO, the CFO, the janitor, several unnamed people, 11 people from the HR Department, potential colleagues, the company barista, a bunch of idiots in suits, several farmers and I cannot even recall who the others are. I know I am very close to getting hired, just as I have been since the 6thround of the interview.” He has gone through several aptitude tests and since most of the interviews are being done online, he had to acquire a more reliable laptop in order to avoid the inconveniences of power outages. He also has some back up internet just in case the next round of interview comes during a fiber cut. Nothing can stop him from reducing hunger and poverty. While his family and friends are concerned that he might hit the retirement age while still going through interviews with One Acre Fund, he thinks otherwise. “These big firms take their time and one of the qualities they look for is persistent. I cannot afford to quit or apply for another job. I must show up every time they call.” Certainly, there is light at the end of the tunnel. The train is coming.

Kenya’s Strategic Guava Reserve Depleted,"November 10, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/11/kenyas-strategic-guava-reserve-depleted/,"In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s strategic guava reserve has been depleted. The culprit? None other than Gabriel Oguda, who has been delving into the reserves every day. Kenya, a nation known for its rich biodiversity and agricultural prowess, is facing an unprecedented crisis. The strategic guava reserve, a national treasure and source of pride, has been depleted. The guava, a humble fruit known for its sweet taste and numerous health benefits, has been a staple in Kenyan households for generations. But now, the nation’s guava supply is in jeopardy. Enter Gabriel Oguda, a man with an insatiable appetite for guavas. Every day, without fail, Oguda has been seen delving into the reserves, his love for the fruit apparently knowing no bounds. His daily raids have left the once abundant reserve barren and desolate. The Aftermath The depletion of the guava reserve has sent shockwaves through the nation. The price of guavas has skyrocketed, leaving many Kenyans unable to afford their beloved fruit. The guava-based economy is on the brink of collapse, and the nation is in a state of panic. As the nation grapples with the guava crisis, questions are being raised about the future of guavas in Kenya. Will the nation ever recover from this guava shortage? Will Gabriel Oguda ever satiate his guava cravings? Only time will tell. In the meantime, Kenyans are urged to ration their guava consumption and report any sightings of Gabriel Oguda near guava reserves. The nation’s guavas depend on it. In the words of a local guava farmer, “We are in a state of guava emergency. This is not just about a fruit. It’s about our heritage, our economy, our very way of life. We must protect our guavas at all costs.” And so, the saga of the strategic guava reserve continues. As the nation holds its breath, one thing is clear – the name Gabriel Oguda will forever be synonymous with the great Kenyan Guava Crisis of 2023.

Jack Ma to Run for President in Africa,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/04/jack-ma-to-run-for-president-in-africa/,"Chinese business magnate, investor and politician Jack Ma has lately been in the news for helping African countries combat Covid-19, and that only seems to be the tip of the iceberg. It is now emerging that Ma has other plans too. He wants to run for presidency in Africa! In a conversation with a Malaysian media outlet, Jack Ma said that it was after a lot of soul searching and consultations with key people in Africa that he decided to take the challenge and offer leadership to Africa. “It is one of the toughest decisions that I have ever made and this is what I want to focus on for all my remaining years on earth.” He said that he wanted to transform Africa in a similar way that China has transformed itself. “If you look at where China was thirty years ago and where we are now, it is an indicator that Africa can transform itself from poverty and dependence into a self-sustaining economy. This is my vision for Africa and I am sure that if I offer leadership for about ten years, Africa will have found its footing and will be able to ‘pull a new China’ in 25 years.” Jack Ma admitted that it would be a challenging task considering that most of Africa has a form of democratic government which is not suited for accelerated development, and was already a failure. However, he forecast that it would not be hard to gain acceptance since the kind of experiences people had faced under democracy were enough to convince people that the current system had failed. Some of the challenges that he would be expected to solve include persistent food shortage, low life expectancy, piling national debts and an absent or struggling manufacturing industry. Technology will play a key role in the transformation. Jack Ma said that he had not settled on which country to run for president, but was working with the African Union and other regional bodies like COMESA to see if he can run for president for the whole of Africa, bringing to reality the United States of Africa. However, he prefers an English-speaking region since most French speaking countries are still under some French rule and therefore the arrangement would not work due to the interference by the French government.

Family of 5 Now has 38 WhatsApp Groups,"March 8, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/03/family-of-5-now-has-38-whatsapp-groups/,"When all you have is a hammer, everything always looks like
a nail and you will result to hammering everything that comes your way. This is the problem facing a family of 2 parents and 3
teenage children which has now resulted to creating a WhatsApp group for every
single thing, with the number of active groups standing at 38 and counting. Our reporter caught with the family at a shopping mall in
Karen, where he was added to one of the WhatsApp groups so that they could
answer his questions in an appropriate way. As soon as he joined the group, he
was met with over 100 notifications with most messages talking about WhatsApp
management. From the chats with the family members, it was evident that
one group could not work for all communications. This was because an important
message about Sunday outing could be ignored by all because the message
preceding it was about homework, and no child wants to appear like they have
read it. Consequently, they would not comment on the Sunday outing, thus missing
the outing altogether. The family now tries to put each communication in the right
box. “Every group is created with a specific agenda in mind. If you want to
complain about who left the toilet seat up, you need to do it in the right
group, else you will not get a response,” said the youngest child who rarely
does any house chore. “I remember once when mum refused to give us pocket money
because we asked in the wrong group. Posting in the wrong place can lead to
serious financial distress.” The parents said that they were not aware that all
communications can be done in one group, as their children had heavily advised
against it. One actually quoted Mark Zuckerberg and a tool called blocking and
suspension from the platform. The groups are expected to grow to 125 in the next one year. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel. We bring to you the best of satire.",PostaMate,satire
Number of People Hospitalized due to ‘Just a Cough’ Spikes in Tanzania,"July 9, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/07/number-of-people-hospitalized-due-to-just-a-cough-spikes-in-tanzania/,"Coughs have become deadly in Tanzania in the past few days, with the number of people admitted in hospital due to ‘just a cough’ rising sharply. The information which is being whispered in hushed tones across Tanzania says that an increased number of people are falling sick and being hospitalized due to a cough. Some acute cases have difficulty breathing but all that is attributed to the cough. Some have ended up in ICU but then, it is just a cough. While coughing is not a deadly disease, health experts in Tanzania are still trying to figure out why the cough has become deadly in the past few days. This is a big blow to the country which has managed to deal with more serious diseases such as Covid-19. The last case of the disease was diagnosed more than a month ago and the affected patients have already been discharged. Tanzania became the second country in the world to beat Covid-19 after President Magufuli declared the country Covid free. They narrowly lost to North Korea. Across the country, people who have a cough are simply taking some citrus concoction and refuse to be bothered by the cough. Many are even avoiding talking about the cough because it’s just a cough.

State Cautions Kenyans Against Using The Solar System,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/12/state-cautions-kenyans-against-using-the-solar-system/,"The government has come out to strongly condemn attempts by a section of Kenyans to bypass Kenya Power by utilizing energy from the sun without paying tariffs. In a move seen by analysts as an attempt to cripple the giant state corporation, some Kenyans have taken to harnessing solar power in what is seen as sabotage to the economy. But in a swift rejoinder, the government has come out guns blazing moving to enact a new set of laws aimed at bringing sanity to the energy sector.In the Draft Energy (Solar Photovoltaic Systems) Regulations, 2020, Energy Regulator, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has set tough licensing and operational conditions for living in the solar system. In the new regulations basking in the sun has been outlawed because it was found to contribute to global warming. “People who use sun to dry their clothes after washing them or farmers who dry their maize after harvesting will also be required to obtain a license” said ERPAs general manager. Speaking in Murang’a during the launch of a Rural Electrification project, he said it was necessary to regulate the use of energy from the sun to avoid depleting it. “The sun generates energy from a process called nuclear fusion. During nuclear fusion, the high pressure and temperature in the sun’s core cause nuclei to separate from their electrons. Hydrogen nuclei fuse to form one helium atom,” he clarified, adding that we need to be careful because Hydrogen is a limited resource. Farmers whose crops use the sun’s energy for photosynthesis are not spared either as they will now be required to obtain a permit and to pay a monthly fee. Under the new laws the Jua Kali sector will be renamed and the stakeholders will be required to operate at night. The use of grass for thatching houses will also be eliminated in a bid to limit the emission of greenhouse gases. “With the enactment of these laws we hope to position Kenya as a competitive destination for foreign investors” added the managing director.

KU Hospital Bans use of X-Ray Machines to Take Selfies,"May 20, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/05/ku-hospital-xray/,"Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital has issued a warning to medics and other hospital staff who have been using hospital X-Ray machines to take selfies. In a memo that was drawn by the Hospital chairperson Prof Olive Mugenda, the hospital warned that anybody found using X-Ray machines to take selfies might lose their jobs. The staff were asked to only consider the selfies during the off-peak times. “We are experiencing delays and loss of revenue due to the high number of people who want to take X-Ray selfies during working hours. This negatively impacts our service delivery, hence income, and should stop. Anybody found taking X-Ray selfie will be dealt with by the management.” The memo caused a stir among the staff involved, most of whom were employed based on ‘connections’ and whom they know. According to hospital security, many of these do not think that exposure to X-Rays could have implications on health. “Some of these people do not know about X-Rays and think that it is a cool camera. They are young, always on social media and they have the jobs courtesy of the parents or relatives.

Government Pleads with Dennis Okari to end the Second Wave of Covid-19,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/10/gok-dennis-okari-covid-19/,"Covid-19 has struck back with a lethal strategy in Kenya – sparing no one and showing no mercy. Just as we had warned you, the virus chose to wait until we are all tired of social distancing and keeping clean. It waited for our politicians to get tired of acting concerned, and also for Kenyans to realize that on one end of the pendulum swing is Covid-19 and the other end we have hunger and other forms of death. Now it is back, and even the government does not have a plan. The initial plan was to go the Tanzanian way, but that route seems too hard for cowards. Luckily, there is another viable solution. Dennis Okari. When the first wave of Covid-19 landed, the numbers were slow at the beginning but started to run away. Fortunately,Dennis Okari played the Robin Hoodwhere with one expose of Covid millionaires, the numbers crumbled and Covid disappeared. This is the man that Kenyans are banking on to act before it is too late. They want him to release the second episode of Covid millionaires, who by now could be Covid billionaires. It worked before and Kenyans are certain that it will work again. “There is something he can do. Let him release episode 2 of Covid millionaires and you will see the curve starting to behave. He is our only hope.” Even the Health CS has added his voice to the call for Dennis Okari to act. “The second wave is here abnormally, and we cannot treat an exponential curve normally.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too.

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Kalenjin and Luo Communities the Biggest Losers in the BBI Battle,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/10/kalenjin-and-luo-communities-the-biggest-losers-in-the-bbi-battle/,"Billions of shillings are about to start flowing as the official campaign period for the Building Bridges Initiative kicks in later this month. While everybody will be a loser (except the politicians), it is now evident that Kalenjin and Luo communities will be the biggest casualties if things go as planned. Even before the final draft of the BBI document is made public, experts have already warned that the level of excitement will be high all over the country, but communities that have a solid kingpin will lose more. “BBI will be decided by the voters, and voters have different prices. Kalenjins will rally behind Ruto while Luos will rally behind Raila. These will not need to be bought, and therefore there will be no budget for them.” On the other hand, Kikuyus are set to cash in on the coming windfall as they currently do not owe allegiance to any major leader, and they will have to be bought. “This is a very advantageous position because money will have to flow, and the Mt Kenya region will need some reasonable financial excitement in order to vote as a block.” The revelation is a major blow to other communities which have been longing for their turn to eat, as it seems that its majorly the people from Mt Kenya who will eat the fruits of BBI. However, that is the best anybody an hope for because after that, all Kenyans will continue to suffer as they have done since the great famine of 1884.

Ken Lusaka haunted by Dreams of Wheelbarrows,"May 13, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/05/ken-lusaka-haunted-by-dreams-of-wheelbarrows/,"Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka is a haunted man. For him, nights are unbearable and darkness brings horrifying dreams that make his life one hell of an existence. The speaker has said that for the past few weeks he is unable to sleep. Nights bring with them dreams of giant sized wheelbarrows that look like Euro Trucks and they keep trying to run over him. Small wheelbarrows also show up but they are fitted with mandibles like giant beetles at the front and a tail with venomous stinger like a scorpion. “I see small wheelbarrows, giant wheelbarrows, autonomous wheelbarrows and kamikaze wheelbarrows coming at me. I see an army of wheelbarrows flying towards me like locusts and my bed feels like a wheelbarrow. I dread the night.” The speaker has sought help from numerous counselors and psychiatrists without success. He has tried sleeping at work just to confuse the haunters but nothing seems to work. He is now asking anyone who can help or recommend a therapist to help. “I am ready for help from whichever side it comes from. Even if my enemies have the cure, I will gladly take it.” However, the nightmares have not prevented him from doing his work at the Senate and to date, Lusaka has remained  fearless, impartial and objective.

2020 KCSE Results Will still be Released this Year,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/08/2020-kcse-results-will-still-be-released-this-year/,"The government has expressed confidence that this year’s KCSE results will be released as scheduled, even though schools remain closed until the end of the year. In what can be considered an operations magic, the education CS Secretary said that Covid-19 would not interfere with the release of the results this year because the government had already prepared for the release of the results in advance. “We prepared the results before Covid-19. This is part of the greater goal to improve efficiency in the Ministry of Education and you can see that it is working. Candidates can expect to get their results in November before they go back to finish the syllabus in January.” Some people wondered how the results will be arrived at yet students will not sit for the exams, but the government assured that that is just a small matter. “You know students who were doing the IGCSE syllabus already got their results even though schools were closed. Why not us?” From the experience of many people who mark the exams, releasing the results even before the exams is not a very difficult task. “You only need to assign a few A’s to Kenya High School, ensure that half of the students get E’s in Mathematics, make sure that girls perform better than boys in English, and lastly give the best student from Northern Kenya a grade C.” “You also remember that last year, KCSE results were announced in a record time – three days before the end of marking. The goal this year was to break the record andrelease the results even before the exams start. This means that Covid-19 should not affect the results.” The news is welcome relief to thousands of candidates whose studies were disrupted this year by Covid-19 in Kenya. Hail Kenya.

Manchester United set to Sign 3 New Penalty takers,"August 21, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/08/manchester-united-set-to-sign-3-new-penalty-takers/,"Manchester United is hoping to sign three new penalty takers in the current transfer window, further strengthening the position of the club as a global Penalty FC. In an unconfirmed report from the Manchester club, it is said that the club seeks to capitalize on penalties during the next season and having the right penalty takers can be a matter of points and death. “Penalties are key to the greater strategy of Manchester United and having the right taker is central to the success of the club. We are aiming as high as Luka Milivojević, Joshua King and Harry Kane.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted on Monday night United’s squad penalty taking needs improving: “We need to strengthen the penalty depth, of course, because it’s going to be a long season and only a couple of weeks rest until we get going again.

“It’s not Personal; It’s Business” – Sauti Sol,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/08/its-not-personal-its-business-sauti-sol/,"Kenyan afro-pop band Sauti Sol has come out (literally) to defend their life choices after Kenyans threatened to cancel them and their music. The band came under fire after they posted a ‘Sol Family’ photo which almost made Ezekiel Mutua to delete Twitter. In the photo, one band member is seen to have made some life choices that angered Kenyans because the unwritten code of conduct in Kenya is that you shall not be gay. In an interview with PostaMate, the band expressed concerns that Kenyans are taking business matters personally. “We know that people are arguing about moral choices here and if that is the case, it is the same way people choose corruption as means to an end. At the end of the day, a corrupt politician makes his money. We are also under obligation to do what brings the greatest returns to the band. So far so good.” While details of the ‘Sol Family’ remain scanty and they prefer it that way, some Kenyans were quick to defend the band online. “They have not said who is who in that family. They could all be cousins, or it could be a group of marriages. There might be five husbands and three wives, or since these people have not declared their gender, they could as well be eight men. It can go as far as the human imagination can reach.” The band has also announced that for the sake of consistency, only three members will be allowed to perform the song ‘sura yako ni mzuri mama.’ “This is to ensure that our song portray a deep meaning that people can relate to without questioning.” The revelation is a big blow to ladies, and Amerix is yet to comment on the matter. However, insiders have revealed that it might not all be business, but lack of business. “This is the stage in life when nothing else brings you pleasure. You have to keep trying out different things until your pleasure will be derived from being different and unique from other people. When you have had it all, got all the money you needed and the finest whisky doesn’t even bring happiness, you have to either choose contentment or something radical. Radical it is.” The country is now waiting for Ezekiel Mutua to decide whether Sauti Sol’s music shall die by lynching or an execution squad.

Ghost Sub-County in Turkana County has been Receiving Government Funds for 7 years,"April 20, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/04/ghost-subcounty-turkana/,"The Auditor General has unearthed a ghost sub-county in Turkana county that has been receiving government funding and staff for 7 years, but does not exist in any map. The Sajiro sub-county, complete with ghost national government administrative officers, public offices maintained by the exchequer, county government officials and public utilities has existed since the beginning of devolution, but only on paper. The report notes that ghost civil servants in the virtual location have been receiving salaries from the government. Surprisingly, the government has always allocated money for infrastructure and other functions. Treasury wires the money to the sub-county, and sub-county offices use the money. The government has even been paying security officers and maintaining offices in the region. All this sounds normal in Nairobi, but they simply do not exist on the ground. The Ministry of Interior & Coordination of National Government refused to comment on the matter.  The Principal Secretary in the ministry said that this was a matter under investigation. However, one officer speaking on the condition of anonymity said that a ghost sub-county could actually exist. “Turkana is a very large county – 230 times bigger than Mombasa and 100 times bigger than Nairobi. It would not be a surprise if a ghost sub-county existed. It is extremely hard to police and monitor such a vast land area.” He however said that investigation is underway and those found to have received money under pretext will be brought to book. Is such a thing even possible? One governance expert said that while it would be unthinkable to have a ghost sub-county in Nairobi or even Nyeri, it is highly possible in Turkana and the whole of Northern Kenya. “I think they are just making the government to pay for the marginalization. The government has always neglected Northern Kenya. No one even bothers to campaign there during elections. Seems they decided to take advantage of the situation and they have done it very efficiently.” Turkana politicians warned that the scandal should not be blown out of proportion because the government only spends less than 2 billion in sub-county operations. This means that the total loss would not exceed 14 billion. “This is not even a drop of what Covid millionaires made. Let it pass.” Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Pastor who Promised Congregation that 2020 Would be their Year of Breakthrough Arrested,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/08/pastor-who-promised-congregation-that-2020-would-be-their-year-of-breakthrough-arrested/,"A pastor in Kenya has found himself in trouble with law after church members asked for his arrest based on misleading information he gave them about year 2020. Members of Kikuyu 7thBaptist Church filed a complain that during an overnight kesha (overnight meeting) to mark the end of the year, the pastor had declared that 2020 would be the year when they would experience total breakthrough. Members claimed that many had taken the promise seriously and made major investment, with one member building a hotel, a school and starting a travel and tours firm in January. All those were closed early in the year and since then, auctioneers have already done their work. “The pastor had assured me that 2020 would be ‘mwaka ambao nitaomoka.’ Right now, I am worse than I was 18 years ago,” said one disgruntled member. “I was to get a promotion but instead I was sent on an unpaid leave.” On his defense, the pastor said that what he had in mind was selling masks and making sanitizers, and blamed the members for not staying in the New Year kesha to the end. “I clearly mentioned that sanitizers and masks would be a big hit, but most members were asleep already while others had left as soon as they heard that 2020 would be their year.” We are not sure which law will be used to charge since it is evident that the church members did not have enough faith.

Kenyatta University Ventilator turns out to be a Faulty Bicycle Pump,"April 13, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/04/kenyatta-university-ventilator-turns-out-to-be-a-faulty-bicycle-pump/,"Unveiled with pomp, color and global media attention, the much-celebrated prototype of the pneumatic ventilator made in Kenyatta University has turned out to be a faulty bicycle pump. The device which had promised to transform the medical engineering in Kenya has turned into disappointment after it emerged that the actual prototype was simply a faulty bicycle foot pump that had a malfunctioning valve. This meant that while it functions normally by inflating or pushing air into any space where it is needed i.e bicycle tires (positive displacement), it would also pull the air out of the same space on reverse. It came about when a student who tried to use the pump to inflate his bike realized that instead of pressurizing the tire, the pump was simply inflating and deflating the tire with each consecutive stroke. He sought help from a biomedical engineering student to repair the pump, but the when the engineering student saw what was happening simply took off with the pump and headed to the lab. Within 12 hours, they had their first prototype. The accidental invention by the students at the University had brought a ray of hope to the country that has a severe shortage of medical ventilator in the midst of Covid-19 pandemics. At the moment, many government and nongovernmental agencies had offered to help them patent their invention and ramp up manufacturing in order to be a global leader in manufacture of ventilators. It has now been ascertained that there is nothing to patent at all. However, all is not lost since it has already been proved that a faulty bicycle pump can work as a ventilator. This means that while the university students may not be able to patent their invention since there is nothing new they have discovered, they still be able to make the ventilators and have them in use. The accident is also some form of good news to the world because as long as any country has bicycle pumps, they are in a position to manufacture the medical ventilators for their own use. Since a bicycle pump is an open source device, the poorest countries can also jump in into immediate manufacturing and get their devices working. The accidental invention from Kenyatta University is not the first medical discovery to have come by accident. It falls in the family of tens of other products in history, such as the X-ray, Quinine, corn flakes, super glue, the pace maker, microwave and penicillin.

"According to Schrödinger’s Cat Experiment, Kim Jong Un is both Dead and Alive",No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/04/according-to-schrodingers-cat-experiment-kim-jong-un-is-both-dead-and-alive/,"North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un has left the world guessing afterperforming a self-surgeryand thereafter going media silent. In a country where the he holds all the titles possible (including the husband of all husbands) and dictates what goes to the media, his absence has left many people in the world worried and angry at the same time. The 36-year-old leader has always wowed the world with his ability to keep his country both rich and poor at the same time, having elite hackers but unable to update Windows, and threatening the United States but also living afraid of many rats that infest the country. It is no wonder that many people are worried that he could be dead, and for this we have both good news and bad news; Kim Jong Un is both dead and alive. In what appears to be his most radical action since taking power nine years ago, Kim Jong Un performed a self-surgery and both died and lived. While this concept is both easy and hard to understand, it has been a thought experiment for a long time and a famous scientist Erwin Schrödinger’s had actually foretold that this would happen. Consequently, Kim Jong Un is simply living the science which most of us have never understood. In the Schrödinger’s cat Experiment which now Kim Jing Un has proved to be correct, a cat is placed in a tiny box with a tiny bit of a radioactive substance. When the radioactive substance decays, it causes a poison or explosion to be released that kills the cat. However, due to some science that both Democrats and Republicans cannot understand, the explosion takes place, but also does not take place. This ends up killing the cat, and also not killing the cat. In that state, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time. This is exactly the state that Kim Jong Un is in. Holed up in an information blackhole called North Korea, with so many people who want him dead but with an ability to kill anyone who dreams of him being dead, the supreme leader is both dead and alive. The good thing is that North Korea is still living in its own world, and information from there never leaks. Long live the Kim. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Uhuru Blames BBI Failure on ‘Scarecrow Attorney General’,"May 14, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/05/uhuru-blames-bbi-failure-on-scarecrow-attorney-general/,"The president has blamed the absence of a substantive attorney General in Kenya for theanti BBI rulingthat was delivered by the High Court this week. In a leaked WhatsApp chat with the famous six – David Murathe, Francis Atwoli, Raila Odinga, Gideon Moi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Muhoho Kenyatta, Uhuru said that Kenya lacks an Attorney General and a decent scarecrow would outperform the current AG office. “I am tired of this office. Even a scarecrow would do better in terms of legal opinions and common sense. What we are getting is one embarrassment after another, and there is no hope for growth or improvement.  I need an Attorney General!” The president went ahead to complain how the current Attorney General admitted that he has never read the new constitution, and believed that it is not necessary to read such a long document because it has no consequences. Uhuru said that he was forced to read the constitution for himself, but due to busy schedule he could not go past the third page which is basically a glossary of terms. Learned friend Kalonzo Musyoka wondered why Uhuru Appointed the current AG if he knew that he would not perform, while Murathe asked Uhuru to simply ignore the Attorney General and operate as if the office did not exist. On his defense, Uhuru said that he did not know that the Office of the Attorney General is consequential, and said that he just offered the job to someone who needed it.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too.

Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat?

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Rasanga Launches one More Isolation Bed,"June 7, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/06/rasanga-launches-one-more-isolation-bed/,"Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga launched one more Isolation bed for Covid-19 patients in Siaya County, increasing the total bed capacity in the County by 10%. In a ceremony that was attended by all the top County Executives, elected leaders, and hundreds of professors from the County, Rasanga said that the new bed marks the greatest increase of hospital capacity in any single county in Kenya in the last 60 days, thus a positive step for Siaya. During the color filled event which did not cost the county too much money, Rasanga also hit back at critics who had been criticizing Siaya County for having only ten isolation beds. He said that the criticism was based on ignorance and lack of understanding of the Health Policy of the County. “For a start, ten beds are better than zero beds. You need to look at it from a position of optimism and realize that ten beds mean ten lives saved, as opposed to zero. We need to have a change of mindset and see things as they rightly are.” “Secondly, having ten beds is the biggest statement of faith that we have near zero tolerance to Covid-19. In Siaya County, we have no room for Corona and there is no way we can have 4000 beds unless if we expect a similar number to contract the disease.

Sakaja Banking on Current Short Rains to Clean up Nairobi,"November 24, 2022",https://postamate.com/2022/11/sakaja-rains-cleanup-nairobi/,"The promise of a clean Nairobi might soon be a reality after Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja partnered with the ongoing short rains to help clean up the city. Speaking after signing the deal, Sakaja said that the heaps of garbage that have been choking the city will soon be wiped off by runoff water into the Nairobi River, and long term into the India Ocean. “We are partnering with nature to do the necessary. The rains usually do a good job and they do not send us an invoice. They also do not take the garbage to Dandora, but sweep everything outside the city. This is our strategic partner.” Nairobi’s waste management problem has been a thorn in the flesh for all the past administrations. While all past leaders know that there can be no lasting solution that does not involve a behavior change by Nairobians, they also know that garbage is a cash cow that can be exploited to amass strategic cash reserves for the next campaigns. “Unless Nairobians stop littering, there is no way the city can be clean. It would cost too much. The solution is to work on a behavior change program that can discourage littering, but this is tedious and takes too long. We’ll just continue doing things the way they have been done before and hope for different results.” On paper, it seems like the rains can clean up Nairobi. However, Sakaja will have an uphill task convincing the rains not to block the drainage channels first. Should this happen, Nairobians will have a twin problem of floods and garbage.

How to Calculate Your Net Worth Based on your Social Media Followers,"January 31, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/01/networth-based-on-social-media-followers/,"The age of owning physical assets died with the birth of Mark Zuckerberg, and only dynasties have tangible assets. Today’s young person has nothing to show at the age of 30, not because they are poor, but because they have different kinds of assets; social media followers. The number of followers you have on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok and others determine how valuable you are to the world. But how exactly do you measure this worth? This is a question that has given social scientists some sleepless nights. Luckily, researchers at PostaMate have found just the right formula to calculate your net worth and we can share with you the formula so that you can value yourself. Here we go. While all followers are created equal, not all platforms are equal. Here is the hierarchy of followers according to experts: To understand this data, you need to know that one follower on Reddit is worth 10 followers on Twitter, 100 followers on LinkedIn and 1000 friends on Facebook. While some platforms do not have followers who are distinct from those following you, it matters that you have more people interested in you than you are interested in them. If you follower 12 people and are followed by 213 people, you are better off than the one who follows 18k people and is followed by 9k people. That is how it works. To be followed means power, and your net worth is high. While you may have followers, do people interact with your content? It is the classic case of a tree falling when there is no one to hear. Even if it makes a sound, all this is pointless. You need to have people liking your posts and engaging with your content. That is a mark of power, hence high net worth. If you always have the same people liking your content, that is not good enough because you are not impacting new people. How then do you apply the formula? It is not hard. N = (P * R * L)0 Where:N is the networth.P is the Platform.R is the ratio of following to followers.L is the average number of unique likes and engagement Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Isaac Mwaura Receives Ruto into his own Heart,No Date,https://postamate.com/2021/01/isaac-mwaura-receives-ruto-into-his-heart/,"Kenyan politician, disability advocate and aspiring Senator for Kiambu County Isaac Mwaura has finally received Ruto into his own heart, making him one of the newest converts of the TangaTanga movement that has taken Central Kenya by storm. Mwaura who hails from Ruiru and is a nominated Senator accepted Ruto during the homecoming party for the recently elected Msambweni MP Feisal Badar. It was a radical step for the sensible politician who despite speaking fluent sense, has managed to garner little support from his home county of Kiambu. “I had resisted the hustler movement for a long time but this time the conviction was very clear. I heard the message of Ruto and I decided to receive him into my heart for my political salvation. I am now firmly rooted in Tangatanga and I have hope for life after 2022.” The move paid off immediately. The politician who had previously managed to attract a crowd of 12 (self, wife, three friends, two bodyguards, two random street children out to see a white man and three potential voters) was welcomed by a mammoth crowd in Githurai, with residents realizing that he is the future of the County. Thousands joined his rally and for the first time, he is making sense to voters. “We used to see ‘Muthungu wa Ruiru’ walking around but we could not understand what he was saying. Now he speaks the hustler language and we are in sync. He now makes a lot of sense and this is a welcome move.” Political experts have suggested that he is now fit to become the next Central Kenya Kingpin, but only time will tell.

Uhuru: “Otieno’s Bed is too Cheap for Government Use”,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/07/uhuru-otienos-bed-is-too-cheap-for-government-use/,"The Office of the President has defended a decision to ignore a local artisan manufacturing hospital beds in Juja, citing the low prices that the artisan was offering. Following social media outcry that Meshack Otieno was sidelined because his second name starts with a small letter instead of a capital letter, the office of the president denied the accusations and added that it was simply a matter of economics. “Otieno was offering his bed for KShs 25,000 as opposed to others who were offering it for only KShs 65,000. That low price cannot work well in a government setting. He is welcome to work with the government if he adjusts his price to a more decent level.” Pressed further to explain why the low price would not work with the government, the response was more bizarre than we expected. “The government has a minimum threshold on what price is acceptable. If you factor in taxes, kickbacks, bribes and the general corruption associated with procurement, you will realize that Otieno may not make any coin from his venture. We are trying to protect him.” Otieno, popularly known as Otis, is now left to continue hawking his beds to private hospitals, most of which have scaled down operations due to Covid-19.

In an attempt to rescue the ailing corporation, PostaMate announced that it was planning to rebrand Posta Kenya and position it as a premier logistics company in Kenya, bringing it back to life and giving a lifeline to thousands of employees who depend on it for day to day life. Posta Kenya has been suffering for long, and although the company cited tough economic times due to Covid-19 as the reason for exit, it is a poorly kept secret that the horse was dead many years ago, and Covid-19 has turned out to be a dignified exit plan for Posta Kenya. PostaMate plans to dispose most of the assets that the corporation owns, especially land which is valued at Kshs 58 billion, and use the proceeds to transform the entity into an effective e-commerce, mail and logistics service provider in the world. Already, the transformation of the corporation has started with PostaMate appointed managers moving in to start the clean up. Employees interviewed said that they were happy with the new move since their jobs were assured, although many expressed fear that they will be forced to work for the first time in their lives. “We are used to idling the whole day. I hope the new sheriffs will not require us to work,” said one employee who spoke on condition of anonymity.

“I Regret for Striking Too Early” – William Ruto,No Date,https://postamate.com/2020/05/i-regret-for-striking-too-early-william-ruto/,"Kenya’s Deputy President Dr William Ruto has spoken up on his humiliating political losses that he has suffered this week, admitting that he lost a battle, but is firmly in the war. Speaking to PostaMate, Dr Ruto said that he had miscalculated his timings and it is just a matter of time before he would work to get his momentum in place in readiness for 2022. He said that those celebrating his losses were doing it prematurely, and it is just a matter of time before he makes a comeback. “I think the biggest mistake I made was striking too early. Getting the time right is a complicated task and in this case, I might have missed a few things. If what is happening today happened in April 2022, it would have been a perfect execution.” Ruto said that he will go back to replenishing his coffers and get ready for the next phase which he has codenamed ‘Operation 420.’ “At the moment, I need to balance the inflows and outflows of cash, and this means I may not spend a lot of money on disloyal supporters but will work to spread myself deeply instead of widely.” The DP is optimistic that by the end of the year, he will have both the Senate and the Parliament firmly under his control and will also have made several inroads into the Judiciary. He emphasized the need for any serious politician to have control of key institutions as this comes handy at the opportune moment. “If we had the judiciary, our members who not have been easily intimidated.

Immediately after death, it was expected that Moi would rise again after three days. Days became weeks, weeks became months and the months are now turning into a year, yet the former president has not shown any sign of a resurrection. It is a situation that has left his political orphans a bit desperate since in politics, he was the game. “We expected that Mzee would one day make a comeback, but we are getting a little impatient,” said an agitated Gideon Moi. “The plaque that covers the grave is still there, although we had patiently been waiting for it to be rolled away one random morning. It is not too late to give up hope but maybe this should be the time when we accept and move on.” Similar sentiments were echoed by Moi’s political protegee Kalonzo Musyoka and Uhuru Kenyatta. “Moi was a great prophet who prophesied that KANU will rule for a hundred years. The prophecy has turned out to be true and the least we expected was his presence to guide us through the 100 years.

Airbnb Business Plummets in Kenya as Fornication Rates Take a Nosedive,"July 3, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/07/airbnb-business-plummets-in-kenya-as-fornication-rates-take-a-nosedive/,"NAIROBI, KENYA — In a shocking turn of events, Kenya’s once-thriving Airbnb market is teetering on the brink of collapse, and the culprit isn’t government regulation or economic woes—it’s a dramatic decline in fornication. The short-term rental giant, long a haven for clandestine romantic rendezvous, is reeling as Kenya’s young people suddenly discover chastity, leaving hosts with empty bookings and a surplus of unused rose petals. For years, Airbnb properties across Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu have been the go-to spots for illicit affairs, discreet hookups, and the occasional “weekend business trip” that suspiciously lacked any actual business. “It was a golden era,” said local Airbnb host James Mwangi, wistfully wiping down an unused hot tub at his ‘Romantic City Escape’ listing. “Adultery was our bread and butter. Couples sneaking around, side-chicks needing a quick hideout—it kept the lights on. Now? It’s just me and my Wi-Fi router, staring at each other.” Market analysts confirm that Kenya’s Airbnb boom was fueled by a robust underground economy of extramarital escapades. “The data doesn’t lie,” said economist Sarah Wanjiku. “In 2023, 68% of Airbnb bookings in urban Kenya were made under suspiciously vague names like ‘John Smith’ or ‘Business Guest,’ often for single-night stays with requests for ‘extra towels’ and ‘no questions asked.’ Adultery was the invisible hand propping up the market.” But the tides of morality are shifting. Kenya’s youth, once reliable patrons of late-night trysts, are reportedly embracing a new wave of virtue. “We’re done with sneaking around,” declared 24-year-old influencer Purity Wambui, sipping a kale smoothie at a Nairobi café. “My generation is all about self-love, mindfulness, and not checking into Airbnbs with someone else’s husband. It’s, like, totally uncool now.” This seismic cultural shift has left Airbnb hosts scrambling. Listings once advertised with winking descriptions like “secluded love nest” or “discreet hideaway with soundproof walls” are gathering digital dust. “I used to get bookings every weekend,” lamented host Mary Akinyi, whose coastal villa once boasted a 4.9-star rating for “privacy.” “Now my calendar’s emptier than a politician’s promise. I even tried rebranding as a ‘family-friendly retreat,’ but who wants to bring their kids to a place with a heart-shaped bed?” The ripple effects are hitting Kenya’s economy hard. Local businesses that thrived on the Airbnb-fueled fornication economy—think candle makers, champagne suppliers, and cleaners specializing in glitter removal—are reporting record losses. “I used to sell 50 bottles of wine a week to Airbnb guests,” said Mombasa liquor store owner Peter Kamau. “Now I’m stuck with a crate of Merlot and a bunch of young people asking for green tea. Green tea!” Airbnb has attempted to pivot, launching a “Virtuous Getaway” campaign to attract the newly chaste demographic with listings touting “meditation corners” and “no Wi-Fi for ultimate purity.” But hosts remain skeptical. “I tried adding a prayer room to my listing,” said Mwangi. “Got one booking from a guy who turned out to be hiding from his wife anyway. Old habits die hard.” As Kenya’s youth continue their moral renaissance, the future of Airbnb hangs in the balance. Some hosts are holding out hope for a revival of the good old days. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” said Akinyi, rearranging rose petals into a sad smiley face. “Give it a few months. Someone’s bound to cheat again.” In the meantime, Kenya’s Airbnb hosts are left to ponder a sobering question: If nobody’s sinning, who’s going to book a one-night stay with a “no questions asked” policy? Only time—and perhaps a few wandering spouses—will tell. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

Ruto Opens Up About Growing Up in a Chapati-less Home,"March 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/ruto-opens-up-about-growing-up-in-a-chapati-less-home/,"President William Ruto has opened up about his harrowing childhood, marred by the absence of that golden, flaky delight: the chapati. Speaking at the inaugural National Chapati Appreciation Symposium (NCAS) held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the President bared his soul, leaving attendees in a state of dough-induced disbelief. “I remember those dark days,” Ruto began, his voice trembling like an under-kneaded dough ball. “We could only dream of chapati. While other children flaunted their perfectly round, ghee-glistened creations, my siblings and I were relegated to the culinary purgatory of ugali and sukuma wiki. Do you know what it’s like to watch your peers dip their chapatis into steaming bowls of beef stew while you’re stuck with a lump of maize flour? It scars a man.” The President’s speech, titled “From Doughless to Dough-Full: My Journey to Chapati Enlightenment,” was punctuated by dramatic pauses, during which aides reportedly passed him tissues and a glass of fermented porridge to steady his nerves. Sources close to the President claim he spent weeks preparing for this moment, practicing his “chapati face”—a melancholic expression designed to elicit maximum sympathy from flour enthusiasts nationwide. Ruto’s confession has reignited the long-simmering debate over Kenya’s “chapati divide,” a socio-economic phenomenon that separates the haves (those with access to rolling pins and non-stick tawas) from the have-nots (those who think “chapati” is just a fancy word for “burnt bread”). Political analysts suggest that Ruto’s revelation is a calculated move to bolster his populist credentials ahead of the 2027 elections, with some dubbing it “the chapati gambit.” “This is political gold,” said Professor Mjengo wa Dough, a self-proclaimed expert in edible politics at the University of Nairobi. “By admitting he couldn’t afford chapati, Ruto is signaling to the common mwananchi that he, too, has tasted the bitterness of a chapati-less existence. It’s like saying, ‘I feel your pain, but also, look at me now—I can afford a whole stack of them!’” Critics, however, were quick to roll out their skepticism. Kalonzo Musyoka, speaking from his palatial home in Karen, dismissed Ruto’s story as “a half-baked attempt at relatability.” Holding aloft a perfectly golden chapati for emphasis, Kalonzi declared, “I grew up eating chapati every day, and let me tell you, it was revolutionary! Ruto’s sob story is just a ploy to distract us from the real issues—like why unga prices are higher than a kite on a windy day.” In a bid to address the chapati crisis, President Ruto announced the formation of the National Chapati Empowerment Taskforce (NCET), a multi-billion-shilling initiative aimed at ensuring that every Kenyan household can afford at least one chapati per week. The taskforce, chaired by a former ugali enthusiast turned chapati evangelist, will oversee the distribution of subsidized flour, cooking oil, and rolling pins to underserved communities. “We will not rest until every Kenyan child can say, ‘Mama, leo ni chapati!’ without fear of disappointment,” Ruto proclaimed, pounding the podium with the ferocity of a chef flattening dough. The initiative has already drawn praise from the Kenya Chapati Manufacturers Association (KCMA), which hailed it as “a step toward dough equity.” As the nation grapples with Ruto’s revelation, one thing is clear: the humble chapati has risen to the forefront of Kenya’s political discourse. Whether this will translate into tangible policy changes or merely serve as fodder for late-night comedy shows remains to be seen. For now, the President’s tale of dough and despair has left Kenyans asking the hard questions: How many chapatis are too many? Is ugali secretly jealous? And, most importantly, who ate the last piece at the NCAS buffet? In the meantime, Ruto has vowed to continue sharing his story, with plans to release a memoir titled “Flourless: My Life Without Chapati,” complete with a foreword by celebrity chef Ali Mandhry and a recipe for “Hustler’s Chapati”—a budget-friendly version made with unga ngano and a prayer. As the symposium drew to a close, attendees were treated to a live chapati-rolling demonstration by the First Lady, who reportedly whispered to aides, “If he mentions chapati one more time, I’m switching to naan.” For now, though, it seems the nation’s love affair with this flaky flatbread is far from over—just like Ruto’s quest to prove he’s the ultimate doughboy.

“I’ll Withdraw my Non-Existent Troops from DRC If You Say They’re Not There!” – Kagame,"March 7, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/03/kagame-rwand-troops-m23/,"Kigali, Rwanda – In a move hailed as a diplomatic checkmate by absolutely no one with a functioning brain, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has offered to withdraw his totally-not-there troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—but only if the international community agrees to a little condition: admitting that Rwanda doesn’t have troops in the DRC in the first place. “I’m a reasonable man,” Kagame declared at a press conference, flanked by a suspiciously well-fed M23 rebel delegation. “If the UN, EU, and those pesky Americans will just sign a little affidavit saying, ‘Nope, no Rwandan boots here,’ I’ll happily pull out the troops I don’t have. The DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi, currently barricaded in Kinshasa with a megaphone and a stack of mineral export receipts, was less amused. “This is like me saying I’ll stop eating fufu if you agree I’ve never tasted it,” he shouted over the border. “Everyone’s seen the Rwandan uniforms! They’re not even subtle—they’ve got ‘Kagame Krew’ embroidered on the back!” The international reaction has been predictably spineless. The UN Security Council convened an emergency session, only to spend three hours debating whether “troops” includes “volunteers with suspiciously good training” before adjourning for coffee. Germany, still smarting from its failed “sanctions sugar” sprinkle on Rwanda last month, mumbled something about “reassessing aid” while quietly booking a trade delegation to Kigali. The UK, ever the innovator, proposed sending Rwanda a shipment of asylum seekers to “guard the border they’re not crossing.” Meanwhile, the M23 rebels—who definitely aren’t a Rwandan proxy—issued a supportive statement from their new headquarters in Bukavu’s fanciest looted villa. “We applaud President Kagame’s bold vision,” said commander Sultani Makenga, polishing a cobalt-encrusted AK-47. “If the world agrees Rwanda’s not here, we’ll stop not-being-here too.

Will the world play along with his troop-less troop withdrawal? Or will they call his bluff and risk finding out just how many rabbits he can pull from that hat?

"Raila Odinga Rigged Out of AU Elections, Blames “Compromised Servers and Election Rigging Veterans”","February 15, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/raila-odinga-au-elections-loss/,"ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — In a shocking turn of events that surprised absolutely no one, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s perennial political phoenix, was once again ousted from a high-stakes election, this time for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Odinga, who has more experience with election disputes than most countries have constitutions, immediately cried foul after the results were announced in Addis Ababa. “This is not just a defeat; it’s a masterclass in rigging,” said Odinga, his voice echoing through the halls of the AU headquarters. “I know rigging when I see it, and this reeks of it.” His team claims the election was decided in a secret server room, where the votes mysteriously ‘recalculated’ themselves in favor of Odinga’s opponent. “We thought we were secure, but it turns out the servers were more compromised than a politician’s promises during election time,” one of his lobbyists lamented. Sources close to Raila Odinga hint at the involvement of a shadowy group known as the “Election Rigging Veterans” (ERV), who allegedly have decades of experience in ensuring their candidates win, no matter the vote count. “These guys are like the Illuminati of election rigging. If they don’t want you to win, you won’t,” said one source, whose identity could not be verified because, let’s face it, who would want to admit knowing about this? Raila, never one to take defeat lying down, has promised to take his grievances to the streets of Addis Ababa. “If they can rig it here, they can rig it anywhere,” he declared, rallying his supporters for mass action. “We’re going to show Addis what Kenyan-style peaceful protests look like!” Local authorities in Addis Ababa are reportedly in panic mode, trying to figure out if this means the city will see an influx of Kenyan protesters or if Odinga just plans to march with his usual crew of loyal supporters. Meanwhile, social media is buzzing with memes about Odinga’s election adventures, with hashtags like #RailaRiggedAgain and #AUServersForSale trending across Africa. One popular meme shows Odinga with a checklist titled “Elections I’ve Lost,” with a new checkbox marked “AU Chairperson.” As Addis Ababa braces for potential protests, the rest of the continent watches with popcorn in hand, wondering if this will be the start of a new saga in the long, storied history of Raila Odinga’s electoral battles. In the meantime, the AU has issued a statement asking everyone to remain calm, assuring that their servers are now “100% secure,” which in election terms might mean they’ve just upgraded from “easily hackable” to “slightly less hackable.” Stay tuned for more updates as this story continues to unfold, or perhaps, unravel.

Addressing the press from her White House office, White proclaimed, “This war on SMDs is officially underway! No demon, medium or small, will stand in our path while I hold this office.” “These diminutive fiends,” she thundered, “have tormented the American people for far too long. Americans are not succumbing to missiles; they’re falling prey to insidious viruses and the petty anxieties of daily life. Mortgages weigh heavily on their souls, distracting them from their true purpose: settling intergalactic debts. When did we, the United States of America, become a nation preoccupied with such trivialities? This ends now!” Justifying her exorbitant salary, Paula White argued that her approach aligns perfectly with the nation’s core principles. “America,” she declared, “is a nation of grand ambitions. We must eliminate any suggestion of small-mindedness.” While some may question her focus on these seemingly minor adversaries, it’s crucial to remember that SMDs are notoriously resilient. Inquired about her strategy for confronting larger demons, Paula White revealed a cunning plan. “We’ll consolidate those behemoths into two distinct categories – a classic American approach! – and then unleash the power of the free market. The forces of capitalism, embodied by DOGE and, of course, our mighty military, will inevitably drive the big demons back to the abyss.

Thousands of CIA Agents Left Twiddling Thumbs After Trump Pulls USAID Cover,"February 4, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/02/cia-agents-exposed-after-usaid-dissolution/,"Washington, D.C. – In a shocking twist that’s more dramatic than a soap opera, President Donald Trump has decided to yank the rug from under the CIA by withdrawing funding from USAID, leaving thousands of covert operatives around the globe without their handy NGO disguise. For decades, USAID has been the perfect cover for CIA agents. Need to spy on a local government? Just bring some seeds and talk about agricultural development. Want to infiltrate a foreign military? Here’s a pamphlet on water purification. But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

"Disciplined, Mature Christian Proudly Declares 100% Success in 2025 Bible Reading Plan—by Day Three",No Date,https://postamate.com/2025/01/local-christian-100-per-cent-succes-in-bible-reading-plan/,"A local Christian couldn’t keep quiet after proudly reporting 100% consistency in reading the Bible daily in 2025. The 22-year-old disciplined and mature Christian noted that his plan to read the entire Bible in one year was already a success, having consistently devoured scripture for the first three days of January, registering a perfect success rate. This, he declared, was a major indication of his commitment to the gospel and high level of spiritual maturity. “I have already covered two chapters in Genesis and one chapter in John using a complicated Bible reading plan I found on the YouVersion Bible app. I aim to make it past the Book of Numbers by mid-October,” said the enthusiastic and spirit-filled Christian. Calling on other struggling believers to embrace spiritual disciplines and shun worldly pleasures, he pointed out that many people failed to follow through with their reading commitments, with most not making it past Deuteronomy last year. Fortunately, he did not have a Bible reading plan last year, but he claimed that based on current records, he would have also registered a 100% success rate. “It is not easy. Pastors struggle with it. Elders struggle with it. People on the worship team can barely read the Bible for one day a month. But I am here to prove to all those people it is doable because I have done it. I also warn those who start a Bible reading plan and abandon it by January 2nd: no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.” We plan to check in with him at the end of January to see his progress but we foresee him not picking up our call.

Ruto Administration Wants Government to Have Say in Appointment of Catholic Bishops,"November 15, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/gok-wants-say-in-catholic-bishops-appointment/,"The Government of Kenya has proposed reforms to the appointment process of Catholic Bishops, citing national security concerns as the reason for their involvement. In a letter addressed to Pope Francis, the Kenyan Government expressed worries that some current Bishops do not meet the standards outlined in Chapter Six of the constitution. They emphasized the need for future appointments to align with constitutional demands. “We recognize the Catholic Church’s well-established structure but aim to hold the Church to the State’s high standards. Our goal is a free, fair, and transparent appointment process that benefits the Church and adheres to Chapter Six of our Constitution. Hence, we call for reforms.” The government further explained its desired role in the appointment process, proposing involvement after the Papal Decision. “Following the Diocesan Consultation and the Apostolic Nuncio, nominees should be vetted by the DCI before their names are sent to the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. We also seek to intervene post-Papal Decision to ensure no irregularities occur between the DCI and Rome.” Additionally, the government expects a prompt response from the Pope, stating, “This is a minor request, and we ask Rome to comply swiftly.” Pope Francis did not comment but responded to our email with the emoji below.

Youth Pastor Exposed as a Normal Guy After Football Match,"October 9, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/youth-pastor-exposed-as-a-normal-guy-after-football-match/,"A youth pastor from a local church has been exposed as a normal guy who could play rough, commit fouls, and lie to the referee after a friendly football match with his youth group. The shocking revelation has caused a stir among the church members, who had always seen him as a saintly and gentle figure. The youth pastor, who goes by the name of John, had organized the football match as a way of bonding with his youth group and teaching them some life lessons. He had told them that the game was not about winning or losing, but about having fun and showing respect and sportsmanship. He had also said that he would play by the rules and set an example for them. However, as soon as the match started, John showed a different side of himself. He was aggressive and competitive, tackling his opponents with force and skill. He also committed several fouls, such as tripping, pushing, and kicking his opponents, without admitting or apologizing for them. The youth pastor even lied to the referee, who was a volunteer from the church, when he was caught offside or handballing. He argued and protested with the referee, claiming that he was innocent or that the referee was biased. The youth group members were shocked and confused by John’s behavior. They had expected him to be calm and fair, but instead, he was fierce and dishonest. They felt betrayed and disappointed by their leader, who had preached to them about honesty and integrity. Some of them even lost their respect and trust for him. The match ended with John’s team winning by a narrow margin of 2-1. John celebrated his victory with joy and pride, while his opponents felt bitter and angry. He tried to hug and congratulate his youth group members, but they avoided him or gave him cold looks. He then tried to give them a speech about how the game was a metaphor for life, and how they should learn from their mistakes and grow from their challenges. But no one listened to him or took him seriously. John later realized that he had made a mistake and that he had damaged his reputation and relationship with his youth group. He apologized to them and the referee, admitting that he had acted inappropriately and that he was not perfect. He said that he was just a normal guy who loved football and who sometimes got carried away by his emotions. John asked for their forgiveness and understanding, hoping that they would still see him as their leader and friend. The youth group members were divided in their reactions. Some of them accepted his apology and forgave him, saying that they understood that he was human and that he had flaws. They said that they still respected him and appreciated his efforts to connect with them. Others were still angry and hurt by his actions, saying that he had betrayed their trust and that he had failed as a leader. They said that they did not want to follow him or listen to him anymore. The church elders were also informed of the incident and decided to take action. They reprimanded John for his behavior and warned him not to repeat it. They also asked him to undergo counseling and mentoring to improve his character and leadership skills. The elders said that they still valued him as a youth pastor, but that he needed to work on his issues and prove himself worthy of his position. The incident has sparked a debate among the church members about the role and expectations of a youth pastor. Some argued that a youth pastor should be a role model and an example for the youth, showing them how to live according to Christian values and principles. They said that a youth pastor should be above reproach and avoid any appearance of evil or wrongdoing. Others argued that a youth pastor should be relatable and authentic for the youth, showing them that he is human and that he struggles with the same issues as they do. They said that a youth pastor should be honest and humble about his weaknesses and failures, and seek help and guidance from God and others.

New Marathon Rule: Medals for the Best Non-East African Runners,"October 8, 2023",https://postamate.com/2023/10/new-marathon-rule-medals-for-the-best-non-east-african-runners/,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has announced a new rule for marathon races starting from 2023: medals will be awarded to the best non-East African runners in addition to the overall winners. The decision was made after years of complaints from runners from other regions who felt they had no chance of competing with the dominant East African athletes, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, explained the rationale behind the new rule: “We want to encourage diversity and inclusivity in our sport, and we recognize that East African runners have a natural advantage over others due to their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and training environment. We hope that by giving medals to the best non-East African runners, we can motivate them to improve their performance and challenge the East African supremacy.” The new rule has received mixed reactions from the running community. Some welcomed it as a fair and positive move, while others criticized it as a form of discrimination and patronization. One of the supporters of the new rule was Mo Farah, the British runner who won four Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Farah, who was born in Somalia but moved to Britain as a child, said: “I think it’s a great idea. It’s not easy to compete with the East Africans, who are so fast and consistent. I know how hard it is because I train with them in Kenya sometimes. They are like machines. They deserve respect and admiration, but so do the other runners who work hard and give their best. This way, everyone can feel proud and rewarded for their efforts.” Some also argued that East Africans were becoming arrogant with even kids winning major marathons. “How can Kelvin Kiptum, a 23 year old break a marathon record? Marathons are won by veterans who have trained for ages to build high tolerance. At this rate, they are not only winning but also disrespecting the world.” One of the opponents of the new rule was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan runner who held the world record for the marathon with a time of 2:01:39.Kipchoge, who also became the first person to run a marathon under two hours in an unofficial event in 2019, said: “I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not fair and respectful to the East Africans, who have earned their success through dedication and discipline. We don’t need any special treatment or recognition. We just want to run and compete with everyone on equal terms. This rule will create division and resentment among the runners, and it will lower the standards and quality of the sport.” The new rule will be implemented in all significant marathon events starting from 2023, including the Boston Marathon, the London Marathon, the Berlin Marathon, and the New York City Marathon. The IAAF said that it will monitor the impact and feedback of the new rule and make adjustments if necessary. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

USAID’s ‘Toilet Towers’ Project in Nairobi Faces Scrutiny Over Accessibility Issues,"April 9, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/usaid-toilet-towers-nairobi/,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing mounting criticism over its multi-billion-dollar sanitation initiative, Flush Flats, a towering complex of high-rise buildings in Nairobi designed to address the city’s dire lack of toilet facilities in informal settlements. Launched two years ago with a staggering $4.7 billion budget, the project has transformed the skyline with its sleek, modern towers, each housing thousands of state-of-the-art flush toilets. Intended to serve the estimated 60% of Nairobi’s population living in slums, Flush Flats was hailed by USAID as a revolutionary step forward in urban sanitation infrastructure. The Flush Flats complex, located on the periphery of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements, consists of multiple 20-story buildings, each containing approximately 5,000 advanced flush toilets equipped with automated flushing systems, antimicrobial surfaces, and solar-powered energy solutions. USAID officials have touted the project as a sustainable and scalable model, designed to combat the pervasive health risks posed by open defecation and overburdened pit latrines. Since its completion last year, the towers have become an unmistakable feature of the city, their glass facades glinting in the sun as a symbol of international development ambition. However, nearly a year into its operation, Flush Flats is under scrutiny for its accessibility challenges. Residents of the informal settlements it serves—many of whom lack even basic sanitation at home—must travel an average of two kilometers to reach the nearest tower. For women and children, who often rely on these facilities after dusk, the journey involves navigating poorly lit, unpaved paths, raising significant safety concerns. Local resident Mary Wambui, a mother of three, expressed frustration in an interview with this outlet: “The toilets are clean and modern, but walking two kilometers at night with my children feels like a punishment, not progress.” USAID data indicates that Flush Flats has served over 200,000 users monthly since opening, a figure the agency cites as evidence of success. The towers feature motion-sensor lighting, voice-activated hygiene assistants, and water recycling systems, reflecting a high-tech approach to a basic need. Yet, the centralized design has led to logistical bottlenecks. Long queues have become a daily occurrence, with wait times stretching up to three hours during peak evening hours. Some residents have resorted to sleeping outside the facilities to secure a spot, while others have abandoned the trek altogether, reverting to less sanitary alternatives closer to home. Community leaders had questioned why USAID opted for a single, consolidated complex rather than distributing smaller toilet blocks throughout the settlements. In response, USAID’s sanitation program director defended the project’s design: “By concentrating resources, we’ve achieved economies of scale and created a lasting infrastructure legacy. Decentralized units would have diluted the impact and strained maintenance budgets.” He added that the agency is exploring solutions, including a pilot shuttle service and the distribution of solar-powered flashlights to improve nighttime access. The project has spurred some unexpected economic activity. Enterprising locals have set up food stalls, chair rentals, and even guided walking tours near the towers, capitalizing on the influx of visitors. However, these developments do little to address the core issue of distance. Women’s groups have called for additional security measures along the routes, citing reports of harassment and theft during late-night walks to the facilities. Flush Flats remains a polarizing endeavor. For USAID, it represents a bold investment in Nairobi’s future, with plans for a Phase II expansion already under discussion. Critics, however, argue that the billions spent on this high-rise sanitation spectacle could have been better allocated to more practical, community-centered solutions. As the project faces an uncertain future over the USAID shutdown, its legacy hangs in the balance— heralded as a modern marvel by some, yet a stark reminder to others that even the grandest infrastructure can fall short if it fails to meet people where they are.

But now, with USAID funding cut, these agents are stuck, literally and figuratively, with nothing but their spy gear and a bunch of confused locals wondering why the “agricultural experts” are suddenly so interested in the national security office. “Honestly, I thought I was here to teach people how to grow potatoes,” confessed one agent, now sipping a latte in a Lagos café, his cover blown. “But now I’m just a guy with a fake mustache and a questionable CV.” In Cape Town, agents were seen hastily burning their USAID business cards, while in Nairobi, a group of operatives were last spotted trying to convince anyone who would listen that they were now just “very passionate tourists.” Back in Washington, CIA Director Gina Haspel was reportedly seen throwing darts at a dartboard with Trump’s face on it, muttering something about “alternative covers” and “maybe we should just start a coffee shop chain.” Meanwhile, Trump, in his infinite wisdom, tweeted, “Who needs spies when you’ve got Twitter? As for the agents, they’re adapting. One enterprising spy in Nairobi has already set up shop as a “consultant for sustainable living,” while another in Addis Ababa is now the proud owner of “Espionage Espresso,” proving once again that when life gives you lemons, or in this case, no USAID, you make… well, you make do.

Canada Builds a 8000 km Wall to Keep out Americans,"November 9, 2024",https://postamate.com/2024/11/canada-builds-a-8000-km-wall-to-keep-out-americans/,"Expecting foolish Americans to attempt to migrate to Canada after Donald Trump won the election, Canada has moved with speed to build a 5-meter-tall wall along its 8000 km border with the US to stop the looming influx of dejected Americans. The move followed a realization that it was the end of the road for Kamala Harris against what many polls had suggested, opening the curtain for another Trump presidency. Anticipating that Americans would try to move to Canada, Canada moved with speed to build a 5-meter tall and 1-meter thick concrete wall complete with an electric fence and bobby traps to keep out the disgusting Americans. And typical of the Canadian politeness, the country was not planning to ask the US to pay for the wall. Instead, Canada has not only built the wall but also painted it on both sides, creating a perfect space for Americans to do their graffiti. That is the closest Americans will get to Canada. Plans are also underway to ban flights from the United States. Instead, Canadians are urging Americans to stay and build their nation. “They got themselves in that situation, and only they can fix it. Let them stay there.” Mexico is also planning for the same, but the US has already done most of the job. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Society of Idiots Grants Mutahi Kagwe a Category 6 Status,"November 22, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/11/mutahi-kagwe-society-of-idiots-award/,"Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has earned himself international recognition after the revered Society of Idiots (SoI) granted him a category 6 status, joining a group of select world leaders who have earned the coveted title. Kagwe, who heads Kenya’s health docket and has steered the country through the Covid-19 pandemic by sheer luck and guesswork received the award for his innovative policies and ability to retain a job when he doesn’t know exactly how health systems work. The award is another milestone for the Ministry of Health, which seeks to vaccinate 20 million Kenyans in 30 days, after managing to vaccinate 4.5 million Kenyans in 8 months. “The category 6 status recognizes Kagwe as a living joke. We seek to recognize people who just joke and exist as a joke.” Said the Chief Idiot of SoI. To be clear, no one knows what the award is about. Neither if a category 6 status is more desirable than category 5, or better than category 7. However, by observing previous awardees, category 6 status is such a great honor in the Society of Idiots. The last person to receive the award (posthumously) was a unpaidAl Shabaab intern who detonated a bomb to test if it was working. A notable mention is a man who wanted to poison his boss, but tasted the tea to check if the cyanide was enough. On his part, Mutahi Kagwe thanked SoI and said that he would continue to live up to the expectations of the revered society. Others who were present to witness the award were several Covid millionaires, relatives of the president who do business with Ministry of Health, and several cartels within NHIF and the wider health sector in Kenya. Other government representatives expressed hope that they too can get the award in the next corruption year. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Atwoli Angrily Throws away his Brain at a Press Conference,"March 9, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/03/atwoli-angrily-throws-away-his-brain-at-a-press-conference/,"The Secretary General of the Central Organization of Trade
Unions (COTU) Francis Atwoli angrily threw away his brain as he tried to make a
point that a brain is not needed in Kenya. During a press conference called to discuss the importance
of voter education and public participation in national development, Atwoli complained
that some sections of the media such as PostaMate have been calling on Kenyans
to use their brains when making political decisions, something impossible to
achieve. Atwoli argued that Kenyans do not need to think in any way
because they have Uhuru Kenyatta and him thinking for him, and therefore the
call to use brains was out of touch with reality. Pressed to explain further what he meant, Atwoli angrily
popped open his head, took out the brain and tossed it into a nearby dustbin,
after which he went ahead to lecture those attending on how brains are overrated
and why no one needs the ‘damn grey and white matter.’ He spoke for a whole 50
minutes without the brain and still sounded like the good old Atwoli. True to his word, nobody seemed to notice the difference in
his speech both before and after he threw away the brain, and it is believed
that he had actually not used it in the last 45 years. Others suggested that he could have been trying to market a
liquid brain protector which he is planning to launch in the next few weeks.
Whatever the case, it is clear that brains are not useful in Kenyan politics. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel. We bring to you the best of satire.",PostaMate,satire
Lastborns Officially Recognized as Bread Losers,"November 26, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/11/lastborns-officially-recognized-as-bread-losers/,"The Division of Social Policy and Development of the United Nations Secretariat has called for the recognition of lastborns as the official bread losers of the family. Seeking to make matters official on something that many people have known, the Secretariat said that lastborns were known to be the financial sinkholes for families and it is the time they were honored for the same. “Our data indicates that lastborns are the reason why many families are still struggling – never mind the same lastborns live like kings. They milk resources from every person and they never give. They are an economic blackhole.” The designation was welcomed by many people who seem to have held the same opinion for long. Some even went ahead to suggest that the position of lastborns should be abolished and no family should suffer the fate of having a lastborn in the current economic conditions. “I think it is time we honored them for who they are,” said an overly taxed first born. “They are designed to be annoying and always ready to invoke higher authority whenever things do not go their way. Yet, they have no shame to demand 27% of your monthly income to spend on a 2-day trip to Dubai!” We spoke to a few lastborns and, honestly, they don’t care whatever you choose to label them.

IMF Under Pressure Agrees to Take Brookside Dairy as Collateral for GoK Loan,"April 5, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/04/imf-loan-kenya-brookside/,"Kenyans on Social Media have successfully forced IMF to use Brookside Dairy as a collateral for the loans they are about to lend Kenya. Following thousands of appeals on their Social Media page, IMF said that any money they lend to Kenya will be secured using the dairy processing firm owned by the president. Should Kenya default, IMF will take over Brookside Dairy and Kenyans will not have anything to lose. “We want to ensure that Kenyans make good use of the money they borrow. The only way to ensure this is to attach key assets so that those in leadership minimize looting the money we lend. This will be a standard practice from today forwards.” Said IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath. Brookside Dairy Limited, owned majorly by Uhuru Kenyatta, has several other shareholders who will suffer collateral damage should GoK default on IMF loan repayment. Kenya’s loan problem has forced the country to borrow money from any willing lender, including International Shylocks such as Eurobond. Even China also has a runningFuliza loan facility for Kenya. While the loans could help the country develop, most of the money is stolen. Recently, President Uhuru Kenyatta admitted thathe does not steal the money alone, hence there are other people involved. Part of the money goes to paykickbacksfor the loans but IMF said that they kickback they receive will be used to offset the loan interest. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below.

Rasanga Launches one More Isolation Bed,"June 7, 2020",https://postamate.com/2020/06/rasanga-launches-one-more-isolation-bed/,"Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga launched one more Isolation bed for Covid-19 patients in Siaya County, increasing the total bed capacity in the County by 10%. In a ceremony that was attended by all the top County Executives, elected leaders, and hundreds of professors from the County, Rasanga said that the new bed marks the greatest increase of hospital capacity in any single county in Kenya in the last 60 days, thus a positive step for Siaya. During the color filled event which did not cost the county too much money, Rasanga also hit back at critics who had been criticizing Siaya County for having only ten isolation beds. He said that the criticism was based on ignorance and lack of understanding of the Health Policy of the County. “For a start, ten beds are better than zero beds. You need to look at it from a position of optimism and realize that ten beds mean ten lives saved, as opposed to zero. We need to have a change of mindset and see things as they rightly are.” “Secondly, having ten beds is the biggest statement of faith that we have near zero tolerance to Covid-19. In Siaya County, we have no room for Corona and there is no way we can have 4000 beds unless if we expect a similar number to contract the disease.

Activists Demand End to Farming to Save Water,"April 1, 2025",https://postamate.com/2025/04/activists-demand-end-to-farming-to-save-water/,"In a bold move to save the planet, a coalition of environmental activists has called for the complete abolition of farming, citing its “unacceptable” use of water and “problematic” impact on the Earth. The group, known as “H2-No More,” rallied outside a local Whole Foods, chanting, “No more farms, no more harm!” while holding signs that read, “Cows Drink, Earth Sinks.” Their solution? A revolutionary diet of rocks, which they claim is “100% sustainable” and “requires zero irrigation.” Spokesperson River Moonbeam, clad in a hemp onesie and sipping from a reusable straw made of recycled dreams, explained the group’s stance. “Farming is the ultimate eco-crime. It uses water—WATER!—to grow food, when we all know water belongs to the fish and the vibes of the universe,” Moonbeam said, pausing to adjust their biodegradable flower crown. “We’re proposing a new way forward: eating rocks. They’re abundant, they don’t need water, and they’re gluten-free. Plus, think of the Instagram aesthetic—#RockDiet is going viral as we speak.” The activists pointed to agriculture’s heavy water usage, noting that crops like almonds and rice are “thirstier than a TikTok influencer at Coachella.” They also blamed cows for “stealing” water to drink and “ruining the planet” with their methane emissions. “Cows are basically walking climate disasters,” said another activist, Skyler Cloudwalker, who admitted they hadn’t eaten a vegetable in years because “plants have feelings too.” When asked how society would survive without food, Cloudwalker shrugged. “We’ll figure it out. Maybe we can 3D-print vibes or something.” Local farmers were quick to respond with a mix of confusion and laughter. “So, let me get this straight,” said John Miller, a third-generation farmer who grows avocados in California. “They want us to stop growing food… to save water… so people can eat rocks? I mean, I’ve heard of farm-to-table, but this is more like quarry-to-stomach.” Miller added that his farm uses sustainable irrigation practices, but the activists weren’t interested in hearing about “Big Farmer propaganda.” Nutritionists also weighed in, gently pointing out that rocks might not provide the necessary nutrients for human survival. “Rocks are primarily composed of minerals like quartz or feldspar, which, while great for geology enthusiasts, aren’t exactly digestible,” said Dr. Linda Carter, a dietitian. “Humans need protein, carbs, and fats—none of which you’ll find in a pebble, unless it’s been marinated in ranch dressing, which I don’t recommend.” H2-No More dismissed the critique as “rockist” and accused Dr. Carter of being “in bed with Big Kale.” The movement has already gained traction online, with influencers posting tutorials on “How to Season Your Granite” and “Top 10 Boulders for Brunch.” One viral video showed a woman blending a smoothie with gravel, oat milk, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt—“for flavor.” Comments ranged from “This cured my hunger forever!” to “My teeth are gone, but I feel so eco-conscious!” Meanwhile, grocery stores are bracing for impact. A spokesperson for Whole Foods said they’re considering a “Rock Aisle” to appease the activists, featuring artisanal stones at $12.99 a pound. “We’re calling it ‘Paleo 2.0,’” the spokesperson said. “It’s what our customers want—sustainability with a side of crunch.” As the debate rages on, H2-No More has vowed to escalate their protests by occupying local farms and replacing tractors with “meditation circles.” Moonbeam remains optimistic. “The future is rock-based, and we’re just the pioneers. One day, you’ll all thank us—probably while chewing on a nice piece of limestone.” Until then, farmers are holding their ground, and the cows, blissfully unaware, continue to drink their water.

"Ruto Promises to Pay Back Four times as Much to anyone he has Stolen from, if Elected President","August 4, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/08/ruto-pay-back-four-times-stolen/,"Deputy President William Ruto is on track to become the fifth president of Kenya, thanks to his tenacity, support from like minded people, and being hated by the president who is hated by many people. Since your enemy’s enemy is your friend, Ruto has found love among Kenyans who will send him to State House as a lesson to Uhuru Kenyatta and associated dynasties. With his well-oiled campaign machine, William Ruto has managed to get most of the Kenyan voters behind him, with the exception of voters from Nyanza region and a few pockets that are royal to their tribal kingpins. It is expected that come Tuesday, 9thAugust 2022, William Ruto will be in State House by 9 am. However, Ruto’s image is not without blemish, for even his close allies admit that corruption is his Achilles’ heel when it comes to governance. He has been accused of stealing, both directly and indirectly through his foot soldiers, although experts agree that he has not stolen more than what dynasties have stolen in the last 56 years. While some have asked for amnesty on all corruption deals done before 2022 if the perpetrators promise to return all ill-gotten wealth, William Ruto has gone a step further and promised to pay back four times as much to anyone he has stolen from, including the country. This will happen if he is elected president. “I am inspired by the actions of Zacchaeus in the Bible, who decided to repay back all the money he had stolen from people, four times over. If I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount, just like Zacchaeus.” Ruto added that he will only do that if elected president, just like Zacchaeus who did the same after meeting Jesus. “Zacchaeus had to meet and dine with Jesus, and my meeting Jesus in this case will be going to State House. Once I dine in State House, I will definitely do my part and pay back everything I have stolen.” Ruto’s promise is not just a political promise, like what politicians do when they need votes. His close supporters have pointed out that Ruto has already began living the promise, which started with giving out his possessions to the poor. “Zacchaeus also promised to give half his possessions to the poor, and Ruto is already doing that. In fact, his opponents have accused him of being too generous and giving brown envelopes full of money to churches, hustlers, schools and other unmanned people. This is a sign that he is a man on a path to do just what he promised.” The new promise further strengthens hisbottom up economic modelthat he has been advocating for, since the money he will pay will mostly go to the people at the bottom.

Biden Begs Taliban not to Destroy the 3 KFC restaurants in Kabul,"August 15, 2021",https://postamate.com/2021/08/biden-taliban-kabul-kfc/,"President Joe Biden has called on the Taliban to avoid bombing, destroying or closing down the three KFC in Kabul as a show of commitment to the country’s shared history with the US. In a cable that was sent to the Taliban, Biden said that both US and Afghanistan have a rich history of shared bullets and the presence of KFCs in Kabul is a sign that the relationship will continue in the foreseeable future. “We want them to respect KFCs because this is what matters at the moment. Destroying those would mean that all the bombs that we ever used in Afghanistan have gone to waste. Let them stand as a monument that we were once there, and we will come back once a more powerful Republican comes to power.” Biden added that the US had left a rich American legacy of three KFCs in Kabul, and those should continue to operate as a sign that ‘America was there.’ Asked whether he knew that the KFCs in Kabul are not the usual KFC but Kabul Fried Chicken, Biden said that that did not matter because they communicate the same message. “They are all about fried chicken, something that our nation patented many years ago. That’s all what matters,” The Taliban are expected to honor the request. Cut out the middleman by joining our Telegram Channel below. This is PostaMate notification channel.
